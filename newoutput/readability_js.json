        "articleBody": "Thereâ€™s an impeachment lesson hiding in the presidentâ€™s failure to produce the political results he wants.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesAmericans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major, statewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature; in Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the governorâ€™s mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.â€œGovernor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!â€� Trump tweeted before Election Day. â€œMatt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT Governor, @MattBevin!â€�Trump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. â€œVirginia, with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with everything planned, go out and vote Republican today,â€� he said.â€œThe people of this country arenâ€™t buyingâ€� impeachment, Trump said at a rally in Louisiana last week. â€œYou see it because weâ€™re going up and theyâ€™re going down.â€�â€œYou gotta give me a big win please,â€� he said later. â€œPlease.â€�Trump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead, they did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the first time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky Democrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state Trump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points. Democrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of victory â€” their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half points, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago, when Republican Phil Bryant won in a landslide.Itâ€™s true that Democrats didnâ€™t run on the issue of impeachment. These races were centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and education. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where health care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy Beshear â€” whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act in the state â€” promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for work requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000 state residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well, where an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the expansion.But just because no one ran on impeachment doesnâ€™t mean it wasnâ€™t in the air. Voters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They could have elevated the presidentâ€™s allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an unambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the presidentâ€™s immediate political fortunes.To start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows majority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that â€œPresident Trumpâ€™s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate.â€� And an overwhelming 70 percent of Americans say that the inciting offense â€” Trumpâ€™s attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating a political rival â€” was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters poll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the House to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most Americans want Congress to investigate Trump if he â€œcommitted impeachable offenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.â€�Worried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have limited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these numbers and election results as vindication â€” proof that Democrats were right to take a narrow, focused approach to the presidentâ€™s wrongdoing.But itâ€™s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the table â€” that thereâ€™s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that tackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the presidentâ€™s phone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not just the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a classified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. These wouldnâ€™t be fishing expeditions â€” given the presidentâ€™s refusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from those of the state, thereâ€™s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior across a range of areas â€” but they would mean a longer process. Democrats couldnâ€™t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to let it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate, remember, took more than two years to unfold.)I donâ€™t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch McConnellâ€™s hands until thereâ€™s a comprehensive case against the president. Yes, thereâ€™s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is any prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage over the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance, especially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would also allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to campaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a trial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full truth of whatâ€™s been happening in the White House under the guise of making America great again.\n"

He also agreed to return the cash he received from the use of â€œWe.â€�\nA spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment.\nWeWork agreed to a rescue by its largest shareholder, Japanese technology investment company SoftBank Group Corp, last month as it faced a cash crunch. SoftBank agreed to inject $6.5 billion in debt and equity into WeWork and to fund a $3 billion buyout of existing shareholders, including $1 billion for some of Neumannâ€™s shares.\nWeWork now faces a radical restructuring. Job cuts will be announced later this week in areas that do not support WeWorkâ€™s core business goals, said The We Companyâ€™s recently named executive chair Marcelo Claure in an email to staff that was reviewed by Reuters.\nThe New York Times reported on Sunday that WeWork is preparing to cut 4,000 jobs. The company itself had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others who work for affiliates.\nNext steps to shape the companyâ€™s future will be divulged in an all-company meeting on Friday, Claure said in the email.\nHe said WeWork needs a more efficient and more customer-centric organization to grow. â€œWe are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and responsibilities,â€� added Claure, who is also an executive at SoftBank.\nAn October 11 presentation to bondholders indicated administrative jobs would be cut, along with jobs in WeWorkâ€™s venture capital arm and in so-called growth-related functions, a possible reference to design and construction units.\nThis is not the first time WeWork has been scrutinized by the NYAG. The company rolled back its policy of requiring employees to sign noncompete agreements after reaching a settlement with the attorney general last year.\nBloomberg News reported on Friday that WeWork is facing scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over whether it violated financial rules as it sought its public listing. WeWork declined to comment on the report.\nWeWorkâ€™s 2025 bond has weakened sharply in the past week, hitting 16.057% on Monday, according to data from MarketAxess.\n(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis, Joshua Franklin, Koh Gui Qing, with reporting by Herb Lash and Megan Davies, editing by Martin Howell.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n"

        "articleBody": " \n        \t\t\tVolkswagen’s first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn’t expected until next year, but the automaker isn ‘t slowing down on stacking up new potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the modular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the most striking yet. \n                 \n\t\t\nYou could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a well-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID. SPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it’s weighing a potential production version for North America and Europe. \n\nThe MEB’s flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker with the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show this week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is – at 195-inches – about as long as a VW Atlas Cross Sport SUV. However it’s narrower and lower. \n\nA 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh lithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it’s enough to give the ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There’s electronic damping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension. \n\nHowever, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to the front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and 517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph could arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited 109 mph. \nAs for range, in RWD form you’re looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP cycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on the EPA cycle. \n\nHelping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW’s engineers used some clever airflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being guided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of the car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate. \n\nDoor handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing wind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up; touch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical lighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined by an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime running lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals. \n\n\nTurbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing them flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption. The roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear. That’s also where you’ll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip crossing the white VW logo. \nAll those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the ID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes headlamps that look like they’re eyes opening. \n\nInside, there’s seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench instead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there’s AppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice production. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done away with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker says it’ll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of the material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination. \n\nThe dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the driver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment, and other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can be assigned to different touch-surface controls. There’s a large, fold-out center console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW’s 20.7 cubic foot trunk has two electric longboards underneath.\n\n\nEven the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch panels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery mode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation and other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively change to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural language voice control is supported, too. \n\nIn a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a luxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes to put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market sometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the ability of that to support more niche models in a way that’s still cost effective. \n\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n               \n        \t\t\t \n         \n        \n                \n"

Since Diwali, despite the Supreme Court ban, the air quality has plunged to alarming levels with the monitoring agency announcing air emergency. Sadly, Delhi pollution has become a standard feature of winter season. With dip in the temperature and slower surface winds, the pollutants have been accumulating in the air that the National Capital is breathing. Amid all this, a news has gone viral on social media about an â€˜oxygen barâ€™!\nYup, you read it right! From The New York Times to the CNN to CondÃ© Nast Traveller, almost all major foreign publications have carried the news about this unique â€˜barâ€™. According to reports, this bar is offering oxygen to anyone who is ready to pay Rs 300 for fresh air for 15 minutes. So, is it true? Do we have an oxygen bar in Delhi?\nThe answer is YES! News Nation tried to find out about this initiative and landed up on the webpage of the mall located in Delhiâ€™s Saket area that offers this unique service. According to the website, the name of the oxygen bar is â€˜Oxy Pureâ€™. â€œAn Indian start-up based out of Delhi-NCR, Oxy Pure was launched with an aim to improve the quality of the air by eradicating the air pollutants in a cost-effective manner,â€� the description on the website reads.\nOffering â€˜rejuvenatingâ€™ experience to the shoppers, the oxygen bar, â€œconsists of an oxygen concentrator that purifies the ambient air, facilitating customers to breathe 80% to 90% pure oxygen from a disposable nasal cannula along with aromatherapy. The session lasts for 10-15 minutes and leaves you with more vigour and energy.â€�\nThe brain behind this well-timed startup is said to be Aryavir Kumar and Margarita Kuritsyna. The duo reportedly saw similar oxygen bar in Las Vegas and decided to set up similar facility in India. The oxygen bar charges Rs 299 for fifteen minutes of pure air. Prices are different for different aromas.\nSo now you know that there IS an oxygen bar in Delhi. Are you planning to visit? Also, in case you want to know, the air quality index in Delhi right now is 218, which is in â€˜poorâ€™ category.

Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also received a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines. Browns DL Sheldon Richardson, however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight on Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his role in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet. Richardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. … You get what's coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"CBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine Rudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds. \n\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more focused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game winning streak come to an end. \"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of things, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much. That's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to learn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"The Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as the NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25 kickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to facing the Browns again. \"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I don't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot [again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at home, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got to put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game, so our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"\n\n        \n            \n"

        "articleBody": "Walt Disney Co. executive Kevin Mayer said overwhelming demand and a computer-coding glitch led to widespread problems last week when the Burbank entertainment giant launched Disney+.The company struggled to contend with the more than 10 million users who activated their accounts last Tuesday. Disney’s $6.99-a-month service is stocked with movies and TV shows from Pixar Animation, “Star Wars,” Marvel Studios and classic Disney fare, including “Mary Poppins” and “Bambi.”There were also more mundane issues, such as assisting people who had forgotten their passwords. Some consumers who sought help on launch day reported telephone wait times that exceeded two hours. Others  reported being abruptly logged off the service.“We had some issues ... we had some customer service issues that didn’t make me feel good,” Mayer, Disney’s chairman of direct-to-consumer and international, said Tuesday at the Vox Media’s Code Media conference in Hollywood. It was his first public appearance since the launch.\nDisney’s tech teams isolated the problem, Mayer said, and “patched” the software as the company continued to sign up additional subscribers throughout the week. \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n    Kevin Mayer, the Disney executive who is overseeing the Disney+ streaming service(Walt Disney Co.)\n        \n    \n\n\nAn undisclosed number of customers signed up for the free weeklong trial, although it is not clear how many have converted to paid subscribers. Mayer hinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.“We’ve never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see ” Mayer said.The streaming service represents a shift in Disney’s business strategy and, potentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered  its business. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney’s  flagship ESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks. \nWhile traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services, such as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3 billion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take on Netflix at its own game. Netflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the so-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry. “We will see the industry shake out a bit,” Mayer said. “Not everyone will succeed.” Wall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best positioned for success, and how many streaming services  consumers will sign up for. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he thinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether subscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.He declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to stream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+ app. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast networks and the cable channel ESPN.Eventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its sports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that would probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.“There will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,” Mayer said. “We want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.” Getting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer’s mettle. He is viewed as a potential successor to Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, and he managed the design and last week’s rollout of the service.\nMayer was named chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international division in March 2018 after years of serving as a business development and corporate strategy executive at the company.He led key acquisitions, including Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and BamTech, the previously little-known firm that provided the technological backbone of Disney’s streaming efforts.It’s the first time in Mayer’s career with Disney that he has been in a hands-on operational role.“Operating is a lot different than a strategy role,” Mayer said. “ I love what I’m doing.”\n"

He was just too good.\"\n    The U.S. had won all previous 15 meetings with their North American neighbours, though they had not met since 1965.\n    FRANCE WINS\n    Two days after clinching the doubles title in the ATP Finals, French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut secured France an opening win.\n    Herbert and Mahut rallied to defeat Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama of Japan 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in the deciding doubles match in Group A, giving top-ranked France a 2-1 victory.\n    The French duo squandered two match points while serving at 5-4, but capitalized on their chance at 6-5 to clinch the victory for last year’s Davis Cup runner-up.   \n\n\n\n    The teams were tied after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga cruised past Uchiyama 6-2, 6-1 and Yoshihito Nishioka defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-2.\n    Herbert and Mahut did not drop a single set in five matches at the ATP Finals, where they defeated Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand in the final on Sunday.\n    \"We know we’ve arrived late from London, but the captain had a lot of confidence in our team,\" Mahut said. \"There was a lot of intensity in the win but we’re really happy today. This was a really difficult tie.\"\n    ARGENTINA CRUISES\n    Argentina comfortably got past Chile 3-0 in Group C, with Guido Pella beating Nicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeating Cristian Garin 6-2, 6-2.\n    The tie was already decided when Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer topped Jarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.\n    \"It’s the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for sure of the year, maybe in my career,\" the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. \"I think Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played unreal tennis.\"\n    KAZAKHSTAN WINS AGAIN   \n\n\n\n    Kazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and clinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.\n    The Group E victory came after Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2). Kukushkin had beaten Botic van de Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n    \"I almost died there,\" Bublik said, jokingly.\n    AUSTRALIA AHEAD\n    Australia beat Colombia behind Nick Kyrgios’ 6-4, 6-4 win over Alejandro Gonzalez and Alex de Minaur’s 6-4, 6-3 victory over Daniel Elahi Galan.\n    Colombia had lost to Belgium on Monday.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n"

Hiking the Boulder Flat Irons September 15, 2014This shop has been compensated by #CollectiveBias, Inc. and its advertiser. All opinions are mine alone.  #HealthyHydration #adWhen you live in a state as beautiful as Colorado it’s impossible to stay inside. We moved here two years ago and we’re still in awe of the beauty and take advantage of it every chance we can get. When you think of Colorado you probably think of the mountains, but one thing that most people don’t realize is that it’s quite arid. Whether you’re out exploring or just hanging around the house, water is a must here. Our hiking survival kit is really very simple.Arrowhead bottled waterbaby carrierhealthy snack barscameraIn the time we’ve lived here and all of the times we’ve been to Boulder, one place we hadn’t yet visited were the Boulder Flatirons. We always have a baby carrier in the car so for our hike we just had to make a pit stop at Walmart for some easy to carry bottled Arrowhead water and healthy snack bars.Red was our water boy for this trip. Armed with some ice packs and a portable cooler bag, the Arrowhead water stayed nice and cold while being easy for a teenager to carry on a mountain hike. We use Arrowhead bottled water because their bottles are made from BPA-free PET plastic.Really, have you ever seen anything so gorgeous? This guy learned the importance of staying hydrated very early on. Soon after we moved here we went to a festival and he didn’t take our warnings to keep hydrated seriously and passed out while waiting in line for a ride. Since that day he has never forgotten to make sure he has water at all times when outside, especially in the warmer months. Even Dub had his Arrowhead water in a cup while getting a piggyback ride from daddy. Our baby carrier is another must-have here. Even though he isn’t a baby anymore he still loves to ride in his carrier. This allows us to do more hiking than we normally would since we don’t have to worry about him being able to keep up or getting tired. While we’re at home we still have to stay hydrated and would love to one day purchase a water cooler for the BPA-free 5-gallon bottles of Arrowhead water. Hopefully, Walmart will have these available soon so we don’t have to make sure we’re home for a delivery. That would be a huge time saver for us. Be sure to visit Arrowhead on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. What is your favorite weekend family activity? How do you make sure that you stay hydrated?ReganRegan is a Southeastern Connecticut native now living in Central Massachusetts with her husband, two sons, and two cats.

        "articleBody": "\nA team led by researchers out of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has confirmed traces of water vapor above the surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa.And that's a big deal as the tiny space rock is one of the highest priority targets in NASA's search for extraterrestrial life, according to the agency.\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" lead researcher and NASA planetary scientist Lucas Paganini said in a NASA statement.According to a paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy on Monday, the NASA team discovered enough water vapor being released from Europa to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes.But while that sounds like a lot, it was only just enough to be detected from Earth.Out of 17 observations by the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which uses a spectrograph to detect the chemical compositions of other planets' atmospheres by scanning the infrared light they release or absorb, the scientists only spotted water vapor in one.\"We suggest that the outgassing of water vapour on Europa occurs at lower levels than previously estimated, with only rare localized events of stronger activity,\" Paganini and his team wrote in the paper.For many years, scientists have suspected that there's water on Europa's surface, and several observations appear to back up that suspicion.More than two decades ago, NASA's Galileo spacecraft found evidence of an electrically conductive fluid on the moon's surface. Then, a 2018 analysis of the data found evidence of massive plumes of liquid. Data previously collected by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope supported the existence of the plumes.\"We performed diligent safety checks to remove possible contaminants in ground-based observations,\" Goddard planetary scientist Avi Mandell said of the water vapor discovery in the statement. \"But, eventually, we'll have to get closer to Europa to see what's really going on.\"A mission to do just that is already lined up.NASA's upcoming Europa Clipper mission will get a much closer look at the icy moon's surface as soon as 2023.The spacecraft will feature a suite of cameras, spectrometers, and a radar to investigate the thickness of Europa's icy shell during 45 flybys — and perhaps yield further insights into the water vapor above the moon's surface while it's there.This article was originally published by Futurism.

        "articleBody": "\n  Another cloud of choking smoke and dust is set to descend upon the 20 million residents of Delhi this week, with forecasters warning that air pollution is likely to reach â€œsevereâ€� or â€œemergencyâ€� levels on Wednesday. The dangerous, dirty air is arising from a mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and rural smoke converging over Indiaâ€™s capital region. \nItâ€™s the latest wave of severe air pollution in recent weeks. Delhiâ€™s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter last month to describe his city as a â€œgas chamber.â€�\n\n\nDelhi has turned into a gas chamber due to smoke from crop burning in neighbouring statesIt is very imp that we protect ourselves from this toxic air. Through pvt & govt schools, we have started distributing 50 lakh masks todayI urge all Delhiites to use them whenever needed pic.twitter.com/MYwRz9euaqâ€” Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) November 1, 2019\n\n\n\nThe gray haze led to canceled flights, closed schools, and created a public health emergency. The government distributed 5 million face masks to schoolchildren.\nLast week, some air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and pollution reached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health Organization. For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day. The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor and reported Wednesday that the air quality index reached 408, earning a rating of â€œhazardous.â€�\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Air pollution in Delhi remains â€œunhealthyâ€� this week. \n      \n      \n        Berkeley Earth\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThis surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and itâ€™s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India. The World Health Organization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the most pollution from PM2.5 â€” particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter that can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems â€” were in India. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there were 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world. India suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of these deaths. Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies of 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\nWhile the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when pollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for years, even from prenatal exposure. With a growing population throughout the country and more people moving to densely packed cities, the risk is worsening for Indians. \nThe dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many emerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies urbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem with roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to distinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water conservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in better governance. \nWhy Delhiâ€™s air pollution gets so bad this time of year\nJoshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and dilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And right now in Delhi, thereâ€™s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\nIn November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up trapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is also landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\nThen there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhiâ€™s more than 10 million vehicles, like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles run on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke motors.  Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80 percent of the regionâ€™s total pollution. Dust from the cityâ€™s construction boom is also a contributor to the cityâ€™s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid fuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation. \nThese sources contribute to Delhiâ€™s year-round pollution. But there are several additional factors making air quality even worse now. \nAs temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning fires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs. \nSome of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off fireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October 27 this year. \n\n\nThe air quality in Delhi was horrific on Sunday, but also depressingly predictable. These extreme pollution events happen across North India every November - not just on Diwali. Citizens have every right to be outraged by the policy inaction that creates these grave health risks. pic.twitter.com/fCX2Ptc7YNâ€” Josh Apte (@joshapte) November 3, 2019\n\n\n\nHowever, one of the largest sources of Delhiâ€™s pollution right now isnâ€™t coming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of year burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and restore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these fires has wafted over the city in recent days. \nAdded together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of residents. â€œItâ€™s like youâ€™re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink thatâ€™s plugged up,â€� Apte said. â€œIt overflows with spectacular consequences.â€�\nDelhiâ€™s air wasnâ€™t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the rise in pollution.\nâ€œIâ€™m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never experienced this pollution,â€� said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. â€œThe [severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened in 2009?â€�\nPrakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is Indiaâ€™s breadbasket, and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this region helped deliver a food surplus to the country. \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Burning crop stubble outside of Delhi is sending smoke into the city and harming air quality. \n      \n      \n        Sakib Ali/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nHowever, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage as farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To combat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act. \nOne of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice production typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first cultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act prohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The delay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers. \nBy most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjabâ€™s water table. But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October rice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter wheat, which is typically sown mid-November. \nThese farms are often run by small-scale farmers that canâ€™t hire a large number of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields of the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and quickest method to prepare for the next planting â€” burning crop stubble. \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        This satellite image from NASAâ€™s worldview satellite shows fires detected (red) near Delhi on Nov. 3, 2019. \n      \n      \n        NASA Worldview\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOf course, itâ€™s not just rural pollution thatâ€™s choking Delhi. The urban sources of pollution â€” traffic, construction, cooking fires â€” have also increased as the regionâ€™s population has boomed by more than 7 million people in the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl. \nTogether, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air quality in Delhi in recent years.\nDelhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are reluctant to take aggressive action\nThis year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting 210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops and explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival. \nBrick kilns and factories have also been shut down this week. Delhi officials also implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of the cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers. Roughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules. However, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution. \nIndiaâ€™s Supreme Court on Monday also issued an injunction against crop burning. Yet fires have continued, showing that enforcement is a problem, and farmers are still in the early days of the crop stubble-burning season.\nAdded together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air quality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say itâ€™s because of shifts in the weather â€” not policy. \nâ€œThis is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to south-easterly, which allowed Delhiâ€™s air to slightly improve,â€� Kurinji Selvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank told CBS News.\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Officials in Delhi handed out more than 5 million air filter masks to schoolchildren amid a spike in air pollution. \n      \n      \n        Sonu Mehta/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nGetting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the sources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. â€œPart of the challenge is that thereâ€™s a character of â€˜Oh no, you first,â€™ â€˜No, you first,â€™â€� Apte said. â€œNo one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would lead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily sharing equal portions of the blame.â€�\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also a political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers, construction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have a seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid the pollution â€” many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious minority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old sectarian wounds. \nDespite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during Indiaâ€™s last election cycle. And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to stop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning, driving, fireworks, and industrial activity. \nâ€œPeople will be up in revolt, theyâ€™ll stop trains, there will be riots, and nobody wants to get into this hassle,â€� Prakash said. â€œItâ€™s actually a very, very noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto points.â€� \nAir pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress. \nMany cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has been fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air quality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from dangerous smog.\nIn the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County regularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the country as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air pollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws. \nBut the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many have made important progress in consistently improving air quality by enforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology. The persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of economic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries. \nThis is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Named for economist Simon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is impoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but beyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as pollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are implemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is getting the worst of both worlds. \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops, pollution gets worse before it gets better.\n      \n      \n        Ecological Economics\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nBut Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash said. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their air quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that Chinaâ€™s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian government, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories and limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it gets done.  The government has since drastically reduced the amount of industrial and agricultural activity around the city.\nâ€œThe beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do it,â€� Prakash said. â€œNothing stands between the decision and the implementation.â€�\nThatâ€™s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To clear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies and incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics, helping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their harvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble. \nIndia also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward charity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers and reduce pollution. \nWithin Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner energy. â€œIf one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to pollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,â€� Prakash said. Itâ€™s not just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and trucks. \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Heavy air pollution in Delhi is shaving years off the lives of millions in Delhi.\n      \n      \n        Biplov Bhuyan/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThat means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable energy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action Summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would more than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to 450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in fossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions. \nIt shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for economic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to accept the tradeoffs. \nWhile some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used, a region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make a difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money, and foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing metropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan, and Lagos, Nigeria. â€œThe problem can be solved,â€� Prakash said. â€œBut what you need is political will and a bit of imagination.â€�\n\n\n"

        "articleBody": "\nIn a joint statement published Oct. 25, the Russian and Syrian defense ministries accused U.S. forces in southern Syriaâ€™s al-Tanf of controlling â€œbandit formationsâ€� and disrupting a United Nations plan to return people in the Rubkan refugee camp to their homes in territory controlled by the Syrian government.\nThe Pentagon rejected these accusations as â€œpatently false,â€� and both independent analysts and sources in the Rukban camp told Polygraph.info the Russian and Syrian claims are false.\n\nThe al-Tanf base\nThe U.S. will keep its military base in al-Tanf after American troops leave Syria under President Donald Trumpâ€™s announcement last month. Some 200 U.S. military personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East observers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq and Syria.\nThe al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer â€œde-confliction zoneâ€� on the Baghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as an outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\nIran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in order to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces. The U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation campaign, Polygraph.info has previously established.\nThe U.S. base is strategically located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\nThe Rukban camp\nThe Rukban camp, also known as the Berm, is located in the desert near Syriaâ€™s border with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the countryâ€™s civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross over to Jordan.\nAccording to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordanâ€™s economy and infrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban crossing point.\nThe population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at around 40,000.\nRussia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian disaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to force the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\n â€œU.S.-controlled bandit formationsâ€�\nThe U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian opposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT â€“ formerly the Free Syrian Army â€“ to fight against Islamic State.\nOmar Lamrani, a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based geopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018 that MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the forefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that the U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as \"certainly absurd.\"\nCharles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at Tufts Universityâ€™s Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the Russian Defense Ministryâ€™s allegations are false.\nâ€œI can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not â€˜controlâ€™ any actors there directly,â€� Simpson said. â€œFrom my interviews, it appears all U.S. interventions in the region are indirect and sparse.â€�\n\nâ€œâ€¦ prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan campâ€�\nA VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban camp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be identified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministryâ€™s claim is â€œabsolutely not true.â€�\nâ€œNot the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing civilians from leaving the camp,â€� the source said. â€œMany people are afraid to return to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They want a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.â€�\nCmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military operation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense ministryâ€™s claim â€œis patently false,â€� and that â€œthe United States is not preventing people from leaving Rukban.â€�\nâ€œRukban is another example of the Assad regimeâ€™s consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,â€� Robertson said.\nHe added: â€œThe (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of starvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are blocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take responsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must continue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.â€�\nUnited Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is â€œworking in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said they need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary guarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure U.N. access to the shelters in Homs.â€�\nSimpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to leave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution.\nâ€œAlthough Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into Jordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border security operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to civilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the region,â€� Simpson said. â€œThis is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban, rather than returning to say, Palmyra.â€�\nRobertson, the U.S. commander, said: â€œThe United States does not support forced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they are hungry. As a principle, we support informed, safe, voluntary, and dignified movements of internally displaced persons within Syria.â€�\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "articleBody": "What was this British royal and his PR aides thinking of when he granted a high-profile interview to the BBC, supposedly to clear his name from association with sex-trafficker billionaire Jeffrey Epstein?Prince Andrew, the nearly 60-year-old younger brother of heir to the British throne, Charles, has reportedly told friends and family that the interview aired at the weekend was a â€œgreat successâ€�.\nIn it, the British royal blankly denied having sex with underage girls supplied to him by the convicted pedophile Epstein who reportedly committed suicide in August while in custody in a US prison. The denials were in spite of the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City mansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for sex parties.\nIn a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is, the general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and disgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but â€œan articulated lorry crashâ€� performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent media suspicions of culpability in Epsteinâ€™s sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has left himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and evasions.\nâ€œPrince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his position as a member of the royal family,â€� said one legal expert, as reported by the Independent newspaper.\nâ€œHis friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition,â€� the expert warned.\nThe answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and contradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of alleged sex victims or knowledge of Epsteinâ€™s â€œunbecomingâ€� behavior (classic aloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an alibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18 years ago â€“ on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a house in London belonging to Epsteinâ€™s madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A photo of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\nBut perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited Epstein in New York in 2010 â€“ after Epstein was released from prison for trafficking a minor for prostitution â€“ in order to terminate his friendship.\nAndrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in person that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of friendship required the British royal spending three days at Epsteinâ€™s orgy mansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\nDuring the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with Epstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how vulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\nHe instead told the BBC interviewer: â€œI took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it [breaking their friendship] over the telephone was the chickenâ€™s way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him.â€�\nOh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The rectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all this purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein contradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were â€œnot closeâ€�.\nHis seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations punctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrewâ€™s otherwise â€œlack of remorseâ€� or â€œsympathyâ€� with the victims of Epsteinâ€™s sex abuse empire, as expressed in the BBC interview.\nLawyers for Epsteinâ€™s victims who are suing his estate will find the interview given by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by prosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-indictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for questioning.\nIt is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice from several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated media fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen Elizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\nIt is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work, publicly-funded royals are.\nAndrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands War (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience allegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body sweating.\nThe former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak. Letâ€™s see if he can keep his royal pants dry this time.\n            \n                The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.\n            \n        \n"

        "articleBody": "Following the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple plans to release a new 13-inch MacBook Pro with a scissor switch keyboard in the first half of 2020, according to industry sources cited by hit-or-miss Taiwanese publication DigiTimes. A preview of the report was shared with paying subscribers.\n 16-inch MacBook Pro's new scissor switch keyboard via iFixit The report claims the display size will remain 13.3 inches, although given the source is DigiTimes, we would not completely rule out hopes of a larger 14-inch display. Wistron and Global Lighting Technologies are said to be among the suppliers of the keyboards for the smaller notebook.\n The new 16-inch MacBook Pro features a redesigned scissor switch keyboard, largely based on the standalone Magic Keyboard for the iMac. Given the tried-and-tested design, the keyboard should prove far more reliable than the troublesome butterfly keyboards used across the MacBook lineup in recent years.\n The 16-inch MacBook Pro also features a physical Esc key and an inverted-T arrow key layout. It is unclear if the 13-inch MacBook Pro will follow suit.\n Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously predicted that Apple will transition its entire notebook lineup to scissor switch keyboards in 2020, including all MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models.\n It would be hardly surprising if Apple completely moves past its butterfly keyboards, which have suffered from issues with sticky, repeating, or nonfunctional keys since their inception in 2016. Apple continues to offer free repairs to affected customers as part of its worldwide service program.\n The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro was last updated in July, while higher-end 13-inch models were refreshed in May.\n"

        "articleBody": "BUFFALO, N.Y. — Hours before Zach Parise’s two-goal performance Tuesday, Wild coach Bruce Boudreau expressed confidence in the veteran winger, saying he always finds a way to start scoring. \n“It takes a little longer now, but he’s playing well now, he’s getting a little bit of confidence back,” Boudreau said before the Wild’s 4-1 win over the Sabres in front of 15,522 in KeyBank Center. “That goes a long way.” \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \nRight now, having scored four times during a three-game streak, Parise is brimming with confidence. \nParise’s first-period goals – he scored at 7:14 and on the power play at 19:56 – gave the Wild a commanding two-goal lead they wouldn’t relinquish. \nFor good measure, Parise blocked a shot in the waning seconds of the third period. \n“That’s perfect,” Boudreau said. “It’s the mark of a true competitor doing things for the team.” \nBarely a week ago, Parise, 35, had scored just once in a 10-game stretch. Wild defenseman Ryan Suter, who joked about Parise’s penchant for changing sticks, could see the frustration on his friend’s face. \n“He’s used to scoring goals, getting points,” he said. \nBut Parise has quickly turned around a tepid start in which he scored just three four times in his first 18 games. \n“You can go either way,” Parise said. “I was going the other way for a little while. But I was able to, I guess, work my way out of it.” \nParise opened the scoring by stripping Sabres center Casey Mittelstadt in the neutral zone and burying Joel Eriksson Ek’s feed on a two-on-one. \nHe tipped Suter’s shot in later, a dagger for the Sabres. \n“He’s starting to feel it a little bit again,” Boudreau said. “And we need those goals.” \nThe Wild still rank at the bottom of the Central Division. Boudreau has been on his players to avoid looking at the standings. \n“It’s hard not to, though,” Suter acknowledged. “We know where we are, we know what we got to do to get out of it, and I thought tonight we took a good step forward.” \nBoudreau gave his players a pep talk Tuesday, telling them to “believe in yourselves” and that the Wild are a “good team.” \n“You’ve beaten some really good teams this year,” he said he said he told them. “You’ve been in every game for the last 10 games. So if you start believing in yourself, then good things are going to happen. \n“I said the same thing when I took over Washington for the first time, because I knew they were a good team but they just weren’t playing good.” \nThe Sabres, having lost eight of their nine 10 games following a scorching start, have been playing awfully. The Wild could sense their frustrations. In the second period, Sabres captain Jack Eichel went after Eriksson Ek and threw punches, although neither player received a fighting major. \n“I didn’t really see him coming,” Eriksson Ek said. “He came off my back and, like, I just wasn’t ready for it.” \nParise said: “We’ve been there. You could tell we were maybe getting under their skin a little bit and not giving them a whole lot to feel good about.” \nEichel said he was “just trying to spark some energy.” \nMeanwhile, Wild goalie Alex Stalock, who subbed for the struggling Devan Dubnyk, looked strong in his 10th outing this season, stopping 30 shots. Sabres defenseman Brandon Montour spoiled his shutout bid 17:46 into the third period. \nDefenseman Jonas Brodin had scored earlier for the Wild before winger Jason Zucker’s empty-net goal sealed it. \nThe Wild lost defenseman Matt Dumba, who sat out the third period, to an undisclosed injury. \n“I haven’t talked to the trainers at all,” Boudreau said. \n  \n"

Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive score and I'm not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk X4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters can't go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can't go over AC1200 speeds), anything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if you run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn't use that over WiFi anyways.\tGet it on Amazon for $67.77\n\nGet Dashlane Password Manager for Free (Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo)\nThis sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane.\nIf you're still using the same password (or a variant of the same password) for every site you visit, you're putting yourself at risk.

It's lighter and the controls are non-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch Pro controller if you buy them separately.

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n Apple was \"pulled into the enterprise,\" CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday in a fireside chat with Salesforce founder and co-CEO Marc Benioff. \nAfter the first iPhones shipped, people began using them for business, forcing the consumer computing giant to adapt quickly, Cook said while visiting Salesforce's Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. \nCustomers \"began to say we want you to do this and that,\" Cook told Benioff, which ultimately meant making the \"best mobile operating system for enterprise.\" \n\"We really took that challenge to heart,\" he said. \n\n\n    [Related: Salesforce Dreamforce Keynote: AI, Integration, Alicia Keys And Protestors] \n\n\nApple's revolutionary smartphone made it evident that personal and business technology would blend in a way nobody had seen before. While some people carry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their personal and professional tasks on the same device. \nApple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are writing custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff. \nWhile that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he's extremely proud of his company's trajectory on that front. \nBenioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has redefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"â€”and someone he's learned a lot from. \nHosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said. \nTo that, Cook joked that he's not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the Dreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff's keynote with a couple songs. \nBut Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he did an internship at the company. \nNow his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base as the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on mobile devices. \nBenioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration. \n\"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I donâ€™t even own a computer anymore and I donâ€™t need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good job.\" \nSalesforce's CEO marveled at Apple's ability to innovate for so many decades. \nCook said the admiration is mutual. \n\"I love the way you're constantly taking all the new things and quickly incorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told Benioff. \nAnd they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba Buena theater on the grounds of San Francisco's Moscone Center, where on the same stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products. \nCook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script in a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\" \n\"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said. \nJobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to exchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such a great leader. \n\"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he passed, you've been so true to him and his values.\" \nAmong those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human right\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook said. \nApple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it's legally required to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while encouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well. \nThose values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to receive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they grew up after entering undocumented. \nCook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love of their country and commitment to it.\" \nPrivacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook said, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\"\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n"

CBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was sentenced to life in federal prison.\nIn a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the kidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child's mother, he drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took the child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her into a room and held her captive.It was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's room. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and hiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers, having visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort Worth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family friend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police Department responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the front passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into the hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry basket.The video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and Webb eventually came out naked.\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in custody; we have her.\"Following a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth deliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping the girl.According to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she and her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother knocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.The victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and smart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical fight\" for her daughter's life.\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for and agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope is that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he will never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox.\n\n  \n"

        "articleBody": "The latest wave of tech-based financial startups have a new angle on the banking sector: They’ll assume that everyone is out of money, then try to monetize their brokeness.So-called neo-banks, or challenger banks, have been all the rage in Europe and Australia for the past few years. Now they’re starting to get attention here in the US, with names like Chime, Varo, SoFi, Current, GoBank, and even—heaven help us—booyah!. Yes, the exclamation point is part of the name. Like Yahoo!. Cutting edge, I know.These neo-banks have been trying to make money in the usual ways: By taking a cut of credit or debit card transactions, collecting interest on consumer deposits, and making loans. The usual banking stuff.Their come-on is that they’re super-convenient, all-digital, mobile alternatives to the big banks. Better yet, they’re focused on their customers’ “financial health,” as one neo-bank CEO told me, and easing the “pain” that people feel around their money.What makes that pain go away? At Chime and Varo, you can get what sounds a little like a neo–payday loan—your paycheck cashed, up to two days before your actual payday. Checking accounts at these startups are often free, and the companies will let you go $50 or $100 into the red before they start charging any overdraft fees. Some have automated savings accounts that invisibly funnel a few dollars from your paycheck into savings.These neo-banks aren’t necessarily even banks at all; some are apps that facilitate transactions, which are then carried out by partners that are banks. Others have applied for bank charters while touting their homegrown technology stacks and hyperpersonalized product offerings (based, of course, on your personal data). But all of them say, explicitly or by intimation, that they’re mission-driven. Their mission is the hot mess that is your finances.The hot mess is very real. Seventy-eight percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Student loan obligations in this country total $1.5 trillion, and researchers believe they’re cutting into millennials’ ability to buy homes, have kids, and save for retirement. More than 40 percent of households have some credit card debt: The average liability is more than $5,000, and the poorer you are, the more you’re likely to have.So what better fix than to slap a slick veneer of tech over basic banking services, push the ouroboros paycheck cycle up by a couple of days, offer some basic budgeting tools, and call it a revolution in consumer banking?Better banking isn’t a bad idea, nor is it a tough sell. There’s definitely an ambient frustration with the megabanks that have destroyed the global economy, bilked consumers with fake accounts and hidden terms, propped themselves up on the comfortable elbow of your overdraft fees, routinely discriminated against people of color, and on and on and on. I mean, there really should be a mission to take customers away from these companies. At minimum, it’s smart to capitalize on all of this well-earned consumer rage.Still, it’s deeply depressing to attend a large gathering of executives, founders, and industry veterans, as I did at October’s Money 20/20 conference, and hear the same, somber message repeated over and over again: The future of money will be predicated on the fact that the personal finances of the next generation are as fragile as a Fabergé egg. This, according to attendees and speakers, is both a problem and an opportunity. No one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation’s finances isn’t technology’s problem to solve.In fact, the idea that the solution to our financial woes can be found in a more convenient, higher-tech, friendlier-named digital bank feels a little like the last story we heard from the tech industry: That the very idea of work could be disrupted by a bunch of apps, too.The same business logic—that you’re trapped in a sad, hellish existence dictated by megacorporations, and tech can free you like Neo from the Matrix—underlies the entire gig economy. It’s the basis for another tech veneer, this one layered over people’s inability to find meaningful work for reasonable pay. Uber got into the financial services game recently, with Uber Money. The headline feature? Real-time earnings for drivers and delivery people, so they can collect immediately, instead of weekly.In fact, we can use the evolution of the gig economy as a case study for how the latest wave of banking disruption might play out.There was a lot that was appealing about the gig economy at first. Those Uber “side hustle” commercials were super cool back in 2016, when driving for Uber or Lyft or Postmates, or shopping for TaskRabbit or letting out a room on Airbnb to cover your hiked-up rent, actually seemed like an opportunity rather than a necessity. Remember when this was about making “extra” money, instead of just barely enough?It was only scale, and the hard realities of American economics, that made these things look a little less consumer-friendly a few years later. As Uber and Lyft grew, driver pay went down. Word got out that unicorn-like businesses could be built by replacing paid employees with a massive network of independent contractors. The model spread. Enter Lugg, Instacart, DoorDash, GrubHub, Prime Now, and Homejoy.This phalanx of apps comprises an army of independent contractors who hope for enough tips to make their labor worthwhile. As their finances have cracked under the strain of small checks, no benefits, and a near-total lack of retirement savings, I guess it was only a matter of time before a fresh set of apps—the neo-banks—were deployed amid the chaos.I’d like to think the mission-driven companies flooding into the US market for financial services will be better for consumers. In the short term, that seems plausible. Cool features, fewer fees, and a helpful person on the phone or online chat could make us happy. Let’s not forget, many people really hate big banks and would rather take their business elsewhere.But there are two problems with this potential disruption.One, it might not end up being so consumer-friendly in the long run. Uber and Lyft ended up paying drivers less as their revenue pressure grew, and they’re raising prices for consumers. Many riders will tell you the quality of the driving, the cars, and the experience has declined over time, which is both inevitable with growth and not surprising given the shrinking pay and incentives.SUBSCRIBESubscribe to WIRED and stay smart with more of your favorite Ideas writers.That will almost certainly also be the case with these neo-banks. Banks won’t lie down and let the disruption happen—they’ll almost certainly buy some of these upstarts and reabsorb reluctant customers. Big Tech incumbents are already honing in on the space. Apple’s (issue-laden) credit card, Amazon’s small business loans and unknown future ambitions, Google’s forthcoming consumer checking accounts, and Facebook’s payment wallets could all eat into the market for new companies.Whether it’s due to competition from banks, each other, or bigger tech companies, neo-bank startups will inevitably go out of business, leaving consumers stranded. That’s pretty disruptive when you’re talking about your checking account. And at some point, the neo-banks will have to make more money, which means their offerings will get less generous over time.A second problem is more serious. Ultimately, no amount of friendly design, accessible features, and overdraft protections will solve the underlying problems that made these services necessary in the first place. No neo-bank can erase the student loan debt or the 40-year stagnation in wages or the unexpected medical expenses or the crippling reality of America’s existential brokeness. The neo-banks have promised that they’ll ease your pain, but that’s just morphine for the real condition. When it comes to the actual sickness, you’re still on your own.More Great WIRED StoriesYouTubers must unionize, no matter what Google saysPaid political ads are not the problem.

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs of 29 November 2018, thirty artworks will light up the city center of Amsterdam for the seventh year in a row. For this years’ edition of Amsterdam Light Festival artists, designers and architects from sixteen different countries share their interpretation of the central theme ‘The Medium is the Message’. All participating artworks will be lit simultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition – in the historical center of Amsterdam – which can be experienced in different ways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time, visitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be presented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the festival. Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019.\nCover image: artist’s impression of the lighting installation by Peter Koros Design at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n\nA selection of the participating artists and artworks:\nIvana Jelić and Pavle Petrović (Serbia) found inspiration for their work Starry Night in Van Gogh’s famous painting of the same name. Since the beginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution, starry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation Starry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night back, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\nGroupe LAPS (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and often integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the festival, the French artist collective designed Spider on the Bridge: eighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on the bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion that the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors are warned!\nAmigo & amigo (Australia) – also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone Chua – explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their technically complex artworks. Parabolic Lightcloud is a cloud of light made with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this installation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors to think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts. Moreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope made out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\nOGE Group (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and Gaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work is characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with Light a Wish as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment you blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the air. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions float above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the festival.\nBalmond Studio (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The studio’s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With Optilli, Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the subjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon as the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The question is: is the displayed image correct?\n\nLight as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam\nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty artworks. This years’ exhibition revolves around the theme ‘The Medium is the Message‘, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and philosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the way we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The participating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play as a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise have remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories is also a central part of this edition.\nOn behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of remarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be released as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn identifies the connection between the city and the central theme.\n\nSome of the lighting installations on show at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival – previews\n\nLight a Wish by OGE Group\n\nParabolic Lightcloud by amigo & amigo\n\nPortam Civitatis by Peter Snijder\n\nSpider on the bridge by Groupe LAPS\n7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n29 November 2018 | 20 January 2019\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"

        "articleBody": "\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday unveiled the first global geological map of Saturn's moon Titan including vast plains and dunes of frozen organic material and lakes of liquid methane, illuminating an exotic world considered a strong candidate in the search for life beyond Earth.\nThe map was based on radar, infrared and other data collected by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017. Titan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the Solar System's second-biggest moon behind Jupiter's Ganymede. It is larger than the planet Mercury.Organic materials - carbon-based compounds critical for fostering living organisms - play a leading role on Titan.\"Organics are very important for the possibility of life on Titan, which many of us think likely would have evolved in the liquid water ocean under Titan's icy crust,\" said planetary geologist Rosaly Lopes of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\"Organic materials can, we think, penetrate down to the liquid water ocean and this can provide nutrients necessary for life, if it evolved there,\" added Lopes, who led the research published in the journal Nature Astronomy.The first global geologic map of Titan. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU)On Earth, water rains down from clouds and fills rivers, lakes and oceans. On Titan, clouds spew hydrocarbons like methane and ethane - which are gases on Earth - in liquid form due to the moon's frigid climate.Rainfall occurs everywhere on Titan, but the equatorial regions are drier than the poles, said study co-author Anezina Solomonidou, a European Space Agency research fellow.Plains (covering 65 percent of the surface) and dunes (covering 17 percent of the surface) made up of frozen bits of methane and other hydrocarbons dominate Titan's mid-latitudes and equatorial regions, respectively.Titan is the only Solar System object other than Earth boasting stable liquids on the surface, with lakes and seas of full of methane being major features at its polar regions. Hilly and mountainous areas, thought to represent exposed portions of Titan's crust of water ice, represent 14 percent of the surface.\"What is really fun to think about is if there are any ways that those more complex organics can go down and mix with water in the deep icy crust or deep subsurface ocean,\" JPL scientist and study co-author Michael Malaska said.Noting that on Earth there is a bacterium that can survive just on a hydrocarbon called acetylene and water, Malaska asked, \"Could it or something like it live in Titan deep in the crust or ocean where temperatures are a little warmer?\"The map was created seven years before the US space agency is set to launch its Dragonfly mission to dispatch a multi-rotor drone to study Titan's chemistry and suitability for life. Dragonfly is scheduled to reach Titan in 2034.\"It is not only scientifically important but also really cool - a drone flying around on Titan,\" Lopes said. \"It will be really exciting.\"(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Tom Brown)© Reuters \n"

One of Alibaba’s New York-listed shares will be worth eight of its Hong Kong shares.The Chinese company’s decision to float in Hong Kong despite months of often-violent anti-government protests is seen as a vote of confidence from Beijing in the city’s status as a Asian financial hub.It is also regarded as significant to Hong Kong, which lost out on Alibaba’s initial public offering to New York in 2013 as the territory would not then accept the company’s unusual governance structure.Small investors in Hong Kong have welcomed the deal, subscribing for so many shares they will be allotted the maximum 10 per cent of the total they can get, Reuters reported.Read more: Tencent profit falls as Alibaba threat and economic woes weighHong Kong’s exchange operates a system where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them getting a greater share of the total offering.Alibaba’s listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange next Tuesday.Main image credit: Getty\n"

        "articleBody": "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, United Arab Emirates vice president and prime minister, center blue sandals, passes a Boeing Co. 787-10 passenger aircraft, operated by Emirates Airlines, during the 15th Dubai Air Show at Dubai World Central (DWC) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Monday, Nov. 13, 2017.Natalie Naccache | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDUBAI, United Arab Emirates â€” Dubai's flagship carrier Emirates Airline finalized a deal to purchase 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliner jets, executives of both companies announced Wednesday at the Dubai Air Show. The deal sets up for a reduction to a prior commitment of 777x jets from the U.S. plane-maker, down by 30 to 126, which Emirates is opting for by employing its substitution rights. The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.The mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines.Â The order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.It comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.Emirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline â€” the largest international carrier in the world â€” will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.As of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.Emirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\n"

        "articleBody": "A \"phase one\" trade deal between the United States and China was supposed to be a limited agreement that would allow leaders from both countries to claim an easy victory while soothing financial markets.\nBut it may morph into something bigger if USÂ President Donald Trump agrees to Beijing's demands to roll back existing tariffs on Chinese goods, people familiar with the talks say.\nChina's commerce ministry said this month that removing tariffs imposed during the trade war is an important condition to any deal. The demand has USÂ officials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of USÂ farm goods, promises of improved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect intellectual property are enough to ask in return.\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to see China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the USÂ maintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to campaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to voters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product purchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand dictate deals instead.\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from the 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and consumer goods.\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in annual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he would likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the USÂ put in place since the trade war started in 2018.\nTrump and USÂ Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such concessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a second person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the USÂ on any deal, and hasn't committed to any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don't, that's it.\"\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an October news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could now be pushed into next year, trade experts say.\nÂ \n\n"

How the diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from the fiery chaos of the Big Bang remains one of the most difficult unsolved puzzles of cosmology.In search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most detailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call TNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains tens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen only in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gases, stars and supermassive black holes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.Â The unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key insights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped galaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black holes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two articles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.Â Related: From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through TimeTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the IllustrisTNG Project, which aims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big Bang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details of individual galaxies.\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting and understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said Paul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and co-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're getting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies that give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems looks like as they form and evolve.\"The model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required 16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany, running continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a single processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most computationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers believe their investment has paid off.\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the study, said in a statement. \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.\"The violent simulated birth of a galaxy cluster where dark matter structures (in white) merge together while supermassive blackholes and supernovae expel cosmic gas away (gas motion is shown in red). (Image credit: TNG Collaboration)That emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe appears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed researchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent clouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered that the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally emerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including spiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive black holes. When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life observations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively consistent with reality.Related: The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our UniverseAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks, another phenomenon began to emerge. Supernova explosions and supermassive black holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas. These outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years above a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back unto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a feedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients for forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's structure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into thin rotating disks.Despite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their model. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for astronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations completed,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better understand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent trends show up in that data.\"15 Amazing Images of Stars11 Fascinating Facts About Our Milky Way GalaxyThe 11 Biggest Unanswered Questions About Dark MatterOriginally published on Live Science.Â Need more space?

        "articleBody": " \n        \t\t\tAudi has revealed the second production model in its e-tron all-electric range, with the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback making its debut at the LA Auto Show. Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.\n                 \n\t\t\nIt’s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile. \n\nAt the front, there’s Audi’s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It’s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road – such as markings – with extra-precision. \n\nFor the rear, there’s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap. \n\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It’ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper. \nEurope will get the option of Audi’s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations. \nPower and Performance\nIn Europe, there’ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They’ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power. \n\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph. \nIt’ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to “S” and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It’s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds. \n\nQuattro is standard, and there’s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select – with seven different drive modes – will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches. \nRange and Charging\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It’s worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors. \n\nStill, there’ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging. \nFor Level 2 stations, there’ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge – which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in – will also be enabled in 2020. \n\nInterior and Technology\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or “frunk,” you’re looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\n\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker’s twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There’ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package. \nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi’s phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional. \n\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there’ll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it’ll also be used to control a new “functions on demand” system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis. \nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems. \n\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback “edition one”: it’ll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020. \nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year. \n\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n               \n        \t\t\t \n         \n        \n                \n"

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\tCrossovers may have become the vehicle of choice for most car buyers, but that doesn't mean the sedan is no longer relevant. In fact, Nissan still believes in sedans for their practicality, space, as well as looks.\nAfter debuting the all-new Juke two months ago, Nissan has taken the covers off the eighth-generation Sentra. Featuring a new head-turning design that is paired to a more luxurious-looking cabin, the compact four-door has been redesigned from the ground-up and is more vibrant than ever.\n\n\"Nissan has a vibrant portfolio of new-generation sedans for customers in the U.S. Market. With more than 6 million Sentra vehicles sold, we believe the all-new Sentra will reach new heights offering refinement and quality, technology and performance not seen before. The lower stance and more athletic design cues from the Maxima sports sedan give Sentra a sexy new look,” said David Kershaw, division vice president, Nissan Sales & Regional Operations at Nissan North America Inc.\nTaking on a sleeker appearance, the 2020 Sentra gets a new V-Motion front grill that is complemented by a pair of eye-catching LED headlights. It also has a more sculpted hood which further accentuates the Sentra's sportier design. Wraparound taillights, meanwhile, give the sedan a sophisticated finish and are of the LED kind as well. A blacked roof along with five-spoke alloy wheels provide the 2020 Sentra an unmistakable look.\n\nInside, the Sentra's interior has been refined and is covered in high quality materials. The seats, the dashboard panel, as well as the steering wheel are all wrapped in fine leather. It also has contrast stitching which spruces up the overall look of the cabin. To improve riding comfort for the driver and front passenger, it has Nissan's NASA-inspired Zero Gravity Seats and come with a heated function.\nIn-car infotainment comes courtesy of an 8-inch touchscreen display. It comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Nissan Connect. It also doubles as a display for the Intelligent Around View Monitor which allows for safer parking / maneuvering.\n\nAn all-new 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine replaces the previous 1.8-liter from before. It puts out 151 PS along with 197 Nm of torque; which Nissan claims is a 20% and 16% improvement respectively compared to the older engine. Besides having more oomph, Nissan said that the new 2.0-liter will deliver better fuel efficiency.\nA bevy of active and passive safety features are available on the 2020 Sentra. These include 10 airbags, rear door alert, intelligent forward collision warning, as well as intelligent driver awareness. Aside from those, driver assist systems such as automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, and high beam assist are also available on the 2020 Sentra.\n\nThe all-new sedan is set to go on sale in the US in late January. As to when will this arrive in the Philippines, we're not entirely sure yet but it could make its ASEAN debut at the 2020 Bangkok International Motor Show. But will we still call it the Sylphy once it arrives here? Let's wait and see.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"

        "articleBody": "Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen went under the knife for a routine surgery in 2009. Hours later, she woke up as a different person â€” and became a great songwriter.\n\n\t\t\t\nThe bizarre odyssey of how Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen came to co-write the euphoric power-ballad that Jessie Buckley performs at the end of â€œWild Roseâ€� â€” easily the yearâ€™s best original movie song â€” began 10 years ago, when the â€œMelvin and Howardâ€� star woke up after a minor arm surgery feeling like her mind was on fire.\nâ€œI felt strange as soon as the anesthesia started to wear off,â€� Steenburgen said. â€œThe best way I can describe it is that it just felt like my brain was only music, and that everything anybody said to me became musical. All of my thoughts became musical. Every street sign became musical. I couldnâ€™t get my mind into any other mode.â€�\nFun as that might sound in an Oliver Sacks kind of way â€” the late neurologist wrote about similar, potentially stroke-inspired symptoms in his book â€œMusicophiliaâ€� â€” Â Steenburgen wasnâ€™t thrilled about the sudden mental shift. The next two months were tough. â€œI couldnâ€™t focus, I couldnâ€™t have acted,â€� she said. â€œI couldnâ€™t have learned any lines. My husband [actor Ted Danson] and I were kind of frightened about it.â€�\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteenburgenâ€™s son, filmmaker Charlie McDowell (â€œThe Discovery,â€� â€œThe One I Loveâ€�), also remembers it as a trying time. â€œIf your mom comes to you after surgery and says that her head is now full of music, I think itâ€™s totally fair to think that sheâ€™s gone crazy and has major psychological problems,â€� he said. â€œAll of a sudden she was referencing these obscure indie bands and picking up random instruments â€” Iâ€™m not gonna lie, the accordion playing drives me nuts,â€�Â McDowell laughed. â€œWhen I say all this out loud it sounds insane. It was definitely a change.â€�\nDespite the paucity of roles for women in their mid-50s, the actress wasnâ€™t exactly itching to do something else. â€œI had been somebody who really liked music,â€� she said, â€œbut I had never been obsessed with it; I was obsessed with acting, and that felt like a big enough subject for me.â€�\nWhen the music didnâ€™t go away, Steenburgen realized that she had to do something with it â€” if only for her sanity â€” even though she didnâ€™t know how to play an instrument. â€œI called a very talented friend of mine on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard and I said: â€˜Look, if I come over every day and sing what I hear in my head, could you help me make them into songs?â€™â€� she said. She wrote hundreds of songs that summer and sent 12 of the best ones to a music lawyer under her motherâ€™s name. â€œHe wanted to work with â€˜Nellie Wall,â€™ but then I showed up instead,â€� she said.\nThe next thing she knew, Steenburgen had been signed to Universal as a songwriter and was on a plane to Nashville. It was the first stride on a strange path that would eventually lead to Tom Harper and Jessie Buckleyâ€™s doorstep almost a decade later.\n\n\n\nFlash-forward to 2017, when Harper â€” a young British filmmaker hot off directing a lush BBC adaptation of â€œWar & Peaceâ€� â€” had just found his next project. Heâ€™d fallen in love with an electric Nicole Taylor script called â€œWild Rose,â€� a fish-out-of-water story about a self-destructive Glaswegian country singer and single mom whose only dream in life is to sing Patsy Cline ballads at Nashvilleâ€™s Grand Ole Opry. Buckley â€” who landed a key role in â€œWar & Peaceâ€� after surging to fame on the U.K. singing competition â€œIâ€™d Do Anythingâ€� â€” had agreed to play Rose-Lynn Harlan, and Harper knew in his bones that she was perfect for the part.\nThere was just one problem: The climactic song that ties the whole movie together didnâ€™t exist. The script called for a soaring, original anthem that Rose-Lynn belts to a loving hometown crowd in the very last scene after sheâ€™s learned to reconcile her dreams with her reality in a way that makes them both feel a little more special, but no details.Â Phoning in from London,Â Harper remembered the anxiety of moving forward without that crucial missing piece: â€œThe script just said something along the lines of, â€˜Rose-Lynn sings an incredible song and it conveys everything that she wants to express to her mom and kids and everyoneâ€™s uplifted. The end,â€™â€� Harper said. â€œI had faith that we could figure it out, but it was really worrying.â€� Universalâ€™s music division provided some demos, but none of them clicked.\nAt the last minute, a sample came in called â€œGlasgow (â€œNo Place Like Homeâ€�). â€œIt grabbed me by the heart the moment I heard it,â€� he said. â€œIt just connected.â€� Buckley, who phoned in from the Chicago set of â€œFargo,â€� had a similar experience: â€œIt was just that immediate feeling of â€˜this is the song.â€™â€�\nThatâ€™s when Harper and Buckley first learned who had written it, and found themselves blindsided by â€œthe Mary Steenburgen of it all.â€�\n&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#65279;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\nAs it turned out, Steenburgen had spent the last few years toiling away on her own dream of making it in Music City. And despite the many advantages that her fame might have afforded her, she was more nervous about going there than Rose-Lynn Harlan has ever been about anything. â€œIt was terrifying,â€� she said. â€œThe first session I did was a total disaster, and I literally went back to my hotel room in tears, cried my eyes out, and thought â€˜Why would anyone be so stupid at age 54 to think they could do something so new?â€™â€�\nBut she also felt like she didnâ€™t have much of a choice. â€œI was back at it by the next morning,â€� she said. â€œI just told myself: â€˜Iâ€™m going to go right up and sing the bleeping song if it kills me!â€™â€� Not long after that, Steenburgen bought a house in Nashville.\nMcDowell still laughs at the memory of hearing his mom spontaneously begin to scat in the backseat of his car. â€œIt could have been really easy for Mary Steenburgen to just put her name on something and get a pass on many of the usual steps in some new creative thing, but she didnâ€™t do that,â€� she said. â€œShe put in the time to learn the craft, and I respect that. And I have to admit, sheâ€™s gotten really good at the accordion.â€�\n\n\nSteenburgenâ€™s career experience also gave her a unique advantage over the competition: While most of the songwriters who submitted demos for â€œWild Roseâ€� were content to read a plot synopsis and work in broad strokes from there, Steenburgen approached the assignment as if the song were a character for her to play. â€œI fought to get the full script, because I just felt like I was looking at such a small part of the story without it,â€� she said. â€œWhere does Rose-Lynn live? What does her apartment look like? I needed to think of imagery that might be cohesive with what the production designer, the cinematographer, and the composer would be doing; there are all these people you havenâ€™t met yet who are telling the same story. And as soon as I read the whole thing, I understood what we were writing.â€�\nThat process led to a realization: â€œIt was a really love song from Rose-Lynn to her mother â€¦It was also a love song to her city and a love song to the concept of home and the fact that home doesnâ€™t have to be second best for her or something that she settles for.â€�\n&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#65279;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\nBoth accomplished songwriters who had previously written music for the television show â€œNashville,â€� Steenburgenâ€™s co-writers Caitlyn Smith and Kate York came to the project with a similar appreciation for the challenge of writing character-driven chords. â€œItâ€™s a totally different muscle,â€� York said. â€œYou have to take yourself out of it a little bit â€” itâ€™s kind of like acting, I guess.â€� Smith agreed: â€œItâ€™s a different job altogether. If youâ€™re just writing a song for someone else, itâ€™s wide open and sometimes hard to figure out. And if youâ€™re writing for yourself, youâ€™re really digging into your own heart.â€� This particular task was a little bit of both. â€œI feel like we could get into the guts of this song because weâ€™ve all lived a similar crazy dream story,â€� Smith said.\nThe first thing they found out is that Rose-Lynn worships Patsy Cline, and so the three writers knew they had to craft something with classic country DNA (not an obvious assumption in a film that builds to a blink-and-youâ€™ll-miss-it cameo from a genre-bending superstar like Kacey Musgraves). Smith seized on something with a 6/8 feel, and they all decided to stay there. But the songwriters also reckoned with the role that Glasgow plays in Rose-Lynnâ€™s life, and not just as an albatross around her neck.\nâ€œAnything we wrote had to have a fond hint of Scotland,â€� Steenburgen said. â€œSo I called one of my best friends, a Scottish woman who started out as a nanny and ended up like a sister,â€� a detail that dovetails eerily well with the plot of the film. â€œSo I called her up and said â€˜Talk to me in your accent â€” talk to me about you.â€™ And through that we wound up with images like the opening line: â€˜Iâ€™ve worn out the stones in front of your doorstep.â€™â€�\n\n\nThe entire song went from a dream to a demo in just a few short hours â€” which, when you listen to â€œGlasgow,â€� seems as crazy as the story that led Steenburgen to co-write it. â€œIt may sound shallow or like itâ€™s a factory when I talk about how fast we write these things,â€� Steenburgen said, â€œbut I always think of it like this: â€˜I canâ€™t take days to do a scene.â€™ I canâ€™t say â€˜I donâ€™t know what the emotion is for the character, so can you give me until tomorrow?â€™ Iâ€™m always having to tell stories on a time limit.â€� Steenburgen has only found one drawback to collaborating with Smith and York: â€œTheyâ€™re such good singers that people are going to get intimidated by their demos and go, â€˜Well I canâ€™t sing like that, so Iâ€™m not doing that song.â€™â€�\nâ€œWild Roseâ€�1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right\nBuckley, who hadnâ€™t sung in a long time before the production, worried about doing justice to a song like â€œGlasgow,â€� especially given that she had no background in country music. â€œBut the story of it really moved me,â€� she said, â€œso I sat down with a guitarist in a room and sang it really badly and just tried to attach some emotional feeling to it before we started filming.â€�\nBy the time Buckley learned who had written the song, she was only half-surprised: â€œIt made sense, because it clearly came from someone with a complex understanding of character â€” someone who was able to kind of go right to the root of what this womanâ€™s story is about, and managed to write lyrics that exposed the cracks under the surface,â€� she said.\nWhile Buckley own story feels something like a fairy tale come true, she drew a distinction with her character. â€œI told her my secrets and she told me hers and we built a different person together,â€� she said. â€œâ€˜Glasgowâ€™ is a song of belonging. Itâ€™s about stretching yourself to places that you donâ€™t know are within yourself.â€� For the first time in a long time, Buckley had something to sing about. â€œThis song was such a gift to me,â€� she said. In turn, it also became her gift to the women who wrote it.\nSteenburgen called Buckleyâ€™s performance â€œstunning,â€� but seemed changed by the experience in a fundamentally different way than everyone else involved. â€œMusic is in my genes thanks to the women in my family, and I just think I was somehow granted access to it,â€� she said. â€œIt was so overwhelming for me in the beginning because I didnâ€™t grow up with having that voice in my head, like Kate and Caitlyn did.â€�\n&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#65279;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\nThe barnstormer of a song that Rose-Lynn performs in the filmâ€™s last scene conveys the ache and discovery of her journey from prison to paradise. It begins with Buckleyâ€™s voice cresting through an ocean of silence, as Rose-Lynn summons the strength to confront her regrets until they resolve into love. She apologizes to her family, her children, and the entire life she tried to escape: â€œI pushed you away, put a pin in a map, then I got lost in the storm.â€�\n\n\nA faint lilt begins to hum behind her, peeking through the lyrics like the first ray of sunshine after a squall: Itâ€™s an accordion, lighting Rose-Lynnâ€™s way towards a place she never could have imagined before. â€œHad to find my own way, make my own mistakes, but you know that I had to go,â€� she sings. â€œAinâ€™t no yellow brick road running through Glasgow, but I found one thatâ€™s stronger than stone.â€�\nAnd then Rose-Lynn hits the chorus with the sweet relief of someone whoâ€™s tunneled their way to freedom, as Buckleyâ€™s voice swells from low to high and back again. She sings on behalf of anyone whoâ€™s ever had to learn about themselves the hard way: â€œAinâ€™t no place like home,â€� she and Rose-Lynn sing together, and as the song becomes so big that it envelopes them both, along with all the Glaswegian extras who packed into Celtic Connections for the 12-hour shoot, and everyone in the audience. Itâ€™s staggering.\nItâ€™s also not the happy ending that Rose-Lynn imagined for herself. And yet, happiness often looks different from how you saw it in your head. When Steenburgenâ€™s life took an unexpected detour, it felt like fate (or a weird quirk of anatomy) was forcing her to choose between the dream sheâ€™d had since she was just a starry-eyed girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the strange new reality that had ambushed her in a hospital one night. To hear it from her now, it sounds like sheâ€™s found a beautiful harmony between the two.\nâ€œI didnâ€™t fall out of love with acting when this happened,â€� Steenburgen said, â€œand I still havenâ€™t. But thereâ€™s so much more capability in our brains than we probably realize, and agreeing to diminishment and shutting down doors is a choice that we all make for ourselves. It turns out you donâ€™t really have to do that.â€�\n&amp;lt;span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#65279;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\nâ€œWild Roseâ€� is now available on DVD and VOD.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPopular on IndieWire\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\tSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

        "articleBody": "EntertainmentAlex Wong | Getty ImagesKristi Noem, governor of South Dakota, pictured at the White House turkey pardon in 2018, when she was a congresswoman. Her new anti-meth campaign is raising eyebrows.Remember New Jersey’s epic quest to find a state slogan?(We never did settle on one, unlike our 565 municipalities, which are packed with them.)Enter South Dakota to throw down the gauntlet. The state’s new slogan for an anti-drug campaign drew a South Dakota-sized share of attention on social media Monday.Just what is this priceless slogan?“Meth. We’re on it.”Yes, that’s it. No joke. The governor of South Dakota would like us to know that her state is on meth. You know, like solving the problem. On it!Of course, you might just be able to see the issue here, besides the fact that Florida Man will have to up the ante next time.And if you haven’t yet noticed what might be wrong, a whole lot of people on Twitter pointed it out.So many people were talking about South Dakota’s odd new slogan that the state and “We’re On It\" became top Twitter trends.According to a report in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, Gov. Kristi Noem launched the campaign on Monday in an effort to address the state’s meth crisis.“Meth. We’re on it” is rolling out with TV commercials and billboards in which people say, “I’m on meth.”The report says the Minneapolis ad agency Broadhead Co. came up with the campaign, and the state has paid the agency nearly $449,000 so far this year.Noem saw the Twitter reaction and ... doubled down on the slogan.“Hey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness,” Noem tweeted. “So I think that’s working.”She proceeded to share the hashtag #MethWeAreOnIt and onmeth.com, the website for the initiative, which contains the following statement:“South Dakota has a problem. There isn’t a single solution because meth is widespread. But we can approach it from different angles, so it doesn’t take over counties, towns, neighborhoods. Let’s work together. Meth. We’re on it.”Still, this isn’t the first time a slogan has gone awry in South Dakota.Consider this 2014 entry — “Don’t jerk and drive,\" meant to discourage drivers from jerking the wheels of their cars while traveling on icy roads.The road safety slogan was an intentional play for a double entendre, but drew enough criticism to get the ax from the state Department of Public Safety.Have a tip?

        "articleBody": "This holiday season I was thinking of flavors that would put me in the holiday spirit when it came to me. Not to be confused with a 1990s grunge band, pear jam is a delicious gift to give for the holidays. With notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove, this honey pear jam recipe will have you spreading Yuletide cheer in no time! It’s so easy and delicious that you’ll want to make some extra for yourself! Is there anything better than a piece of toast or a biscuit topped with a dollop of jam? Especially homemade jam. Not many things are more homey and comforting than jam that has been made in someone’s kitchen. Up until not too long ago, I used to think that people who made their own jam must be wizards. Jam has always seemed like one of those things that only other people made, and then I tried it. Honestly, it’s so easy that anyone can do it with a few simple ingredients and not much equipment. Related post: Pickled Brussels Sprouts RecipeWHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE JAMDo you make jam in a pot? A pressure canner? I don’t know. Help! The simple answer is that foods with low acidity need to be canned in a pressure canner. For this jam, though, all you need is an inexpensive water bath canner with a rack. A water bath canner is really just a big porcelain stockpot that will hold about ten canning jars depending on their size. They also come with a rack that makes removing your jars easier and keeps them from coming in contact with the bottom of the canner. In addition to the canner pot, you will need some mason jars (I prefer 8-ounce jelly jars), a ladle, and something to remove the hot jars from boiling water. You could get creative or just use a jar lifter which is a nifty set of tongs made specifically to fit over mason jars. Now that you have your equipment, you will need the ingredients. About 8 ripe pears, a fresh lemon, fruit pectin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves, and a 16-ounce Don Victor® Orange Blossom Comb Honey Globe Jar. Before getting your jam mixture ready, fill your canner to the line on the inside and set it to simmer. Add your jelly jars and let them get warm while you make your jam. Cube and peel the pears with a paring knife and put them in a large pot. To the pears, add the juice of one lemon and spices. Stir together and taste test it to make sure your flavors are where you want them to be before adding the fruit pectin powder. Heat to boiling for a minute or so to combine the spices and pears, then add a jar Don Victor® Honey, or about a cup and a half. Let the mixture boil until thickened on the back of a spoon, or about 5-8 minutes. HOW TO USE A WATER BATH CANNERWhen your jam mixture is the correct consistency, use a ladle to transfer the mixture into the warm and sterilized jelly jars. I may or may not have been going a little too fast and spilled some hot jam on my hand. I don’t recommend that, so please pour slowly and carefully. Now that your jars are filled, put the tops on, lower the rack into the canner, and use your jar lifter to lower the jars into the water one at a time. Turn the stove up from simmering to boil the jars for *10 minutes. If you live at an altitude of more than 1000 feet as I do, you will need to adjust your boiling time. There are altitude charts available online. We are at 5280 feet in Denver so I boiled mine for 20 minutes.Remove the jars from the boiling water and let them cool for several hours. If your jam looks runny, don’t worry. It will thicken as it cools. It could take 24-48 hours to really look like jam. GIVING THE GIFT OF HOMEMADE JAMIf you choose to gift your honey pear jam to friends and family, there are so many ways you can present your gift. Make cute labels, put it in a gift basket, or add a piece of fabric and a ribbon to dress up the jar and pass them out to your friends and family. No matter how you choose to present your gift, it’s sure to be a winner. Decorating the top of your jelly jars with fabric is super simple. Cut a piece of fabric in a circle to use as a cover for your jelly jars and fasten with a ribbon to make them extra festive. Set them aside in a pretty basket if you wish, ready to hand out to your friends, family, and coworkers. USING HONEY INSTEAD OF SUGARI like to use honey because it has more flavor than sugar. In general, when substituting honey for sugar in a recipe you will use about half the amount. For instance, the original recipe for this jam called for three cups of sugar, but I only use a cup and a half of honey. Both the pear jam and honey are a delicious addition to toast, biscuits, or homemade vanilla scones.   Spiced Honey Pear Jam Ingredients 8-9 ripe pears, cored and peeled 1 lemon, or about 1/4 cup lemon juice 6 tbsp fruit pectin powder 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp nutmeg 1 tsp ground ginger 1/2 tsp ground cloves 1 jar Don Victor® Honey, or 1 1/2 cupsInstructionsFill canner with water and set it to simmer. Add empty jelly jars to sterilize and warm.Core, peel, and cube the pears and put them in a pot. Add the juice of one lemon, spices, and fruit pectin. Boil while stirring frequently for about a minuteAdd 1 1/2 cups Don Victor® Honey and boil until thickened enough to stick to the spoon.Spoon jam mixture into jelly jars, put the top on, and put them in a water bath canner, increasing the heat to a easy boil.Boil for *10 minutes (if over 1000 feet, adjust for altitude)Remove from canner and allow to cool. Jam will set within 24-48 hours.You may also like:  ReganRegan is a Southeastern Connecticut native now living in Central Massachusetts with her husband, two sons, and two cats.

        "articleBody": "Washington, DC, United States: Getting to the Moon, while not easy, has been done. Staying on the Moon and reaching Mars, however, havenâ€™t. Why? Because space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\nIt is for that reason that the United States's space agency NASA on Monday enlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space industryâ€™s upstarts - Amazon founder Jeff Bezosâ€™sÂ Blue Origin and Elon Muskâ€™s SpaceX among them - to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon shot.\nMore:\n\n\nThe New Space Race\n\n\n\n\nSpacewalking into 'her-story'\n\n\n\n\nChina completes landing test for its first Mars mission in 2020\n\n\nâ€œWe have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had enhanced lander capabilities,â€� Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASAâ€™s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference call with media.\nâ€œThis is based on our objectives, the agencyâ€™s objectives, to get to the moon as soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human exploration standpoint,â€� he said.\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for contracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments, and to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed  to that timeline. \nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASAâ€™s Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted â€œtechnical challenges, cost increases and   schedule delaysâ€�. The report and Mondayâ€™s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agencyâ€™s 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\nIn May, NASAâ€™s Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expanded to Jupiterâ€™s moon Europa, as NASAâ€™s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moonâ€™s icy crust.\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life - chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water - are on Europa.\nCloser to home, NASAâ€™s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earthâ€™s moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions - Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX - are notable for not having been on last yearâ€™s original list.\nâ€œWeâ€™re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,â€� said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. â€œItâ€™s very exciting times. Weâ€™re using our Blue Moon lander, which is [a] big one.â€�\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value  of $2.6bn over the next decade. \nâ€œSpace exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,â€� said Michael Sims, CEO and Founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\nâ€œThere are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players. And we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity that adds to the mix.â€�\n"

        "articleBody": "\n\n  \n\n    \n            \n          Experience is thrilled to have Junior Gaspard, long time ExpApper, as our new President and CEO.\nWe’ve asked him to share some insights into the business of Experience and what’s next on the horizon for the company.\nAlso, we hope you have as much fun as we did getting to know him better! Here’s what he had to say…\nQ: Junior – We are so excited to have you as our new President and CEO. When you woke up that first morning and you were officially in charge, what are two words to describe how it felt?\nA: Inspired and humbled! To be in this role, for this awesome company, at this particular time, is tremendous. Words cannot describe how much I love Experience and am honored to be here serving as President and CEO. There has been a lot of change in the live entertainment and ticketing industry over the past six years since I joined the company. Being able to play a role in that change has been a lot of fun. I wake up every day looking forward to coming to work as Experience is impacting the next wave of innovation in the industry. Also, our products, people and partners are top notch and inspire me each and every day!\nQ: What’s the one thing you’ve learned in your past roles that is the most helpful as CEO?\nA: I think the importance of empathetic listening to truly understand where a person is coming from is the biggest lesson I’ve learned. I would also add being comfortable making decisions with imperfect information is critical. You must be data driven when evaluating where to go and what to do, but in a rapidly evolving market, you’re never going to always have 100 percent complete information. When that happens, you have to be comfortable with that reality and be prepared to make decisions regardless.\nQ: How do you prioritize your day?\nA: I have been well served in my career by using Steven Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as a guide. One of the habits – “Put first things first”, ensures I keep the things that are most important and urgent at the top of the list. I also use Wunderlist as a tool for knocking out smaller items on the to-do list. I block time for meetings and separate time for emails so I’m not back and forth all day and can stay focused on the task at hand.\n        \n\n        \n          \n            The best thing about Experience are the people who work here and our outstanding 350 partners - you couldn’t ask for better of either.  Our employees are smart, dedicated, and enthusiastic, I’m honored to serve them every day as we continue on this journey to change the ticketing industry.  Our partners are innovative, collaborative and willing to try new things with us, which is priceless.\n                      \n        \n        \n\n          \n            \n          \n\n        \n\n        \n          Q: What’s on the horizon for the business?\nA: We are moving subscription access to the next level with our direct to consumer offering called INWEGO which offers unlimited access to tickets for a flat fee each month. Also, we are working directly with partners to create a dedicated area of their venue for subscription access. This idea of a section just for subscription is a new take and one that we think will change the industry and ticketing forever. Our product will also be using data in a new way to be more prescriptive and predictive. Our partners will be able to target fans with more relevant offers and experiences and we’ll be much more intelligent about fan preferences and profiles. No one else can combine the technology, a proven track record and relationships like Experience – we can’t wait to roll this out, so stay tuned!\nQ: So far in your journey, tell me one thing that has surprised you the most?\nA: Being President and CEO requires that you look at all facets of the business each and every day. The thing that has been most surprising is the number of constituents you have and the need to invest in those relationships regularly.

Open the door! We’re coming in!” an officer shouts.'We Got Her!' Video Shows Dramatic Rescue of Kidnapped GirlThe suspect said he needed to get dressed.Police used a ram to force open the door.\"Hands! Let me see your hands!\" an officer ordered. \"Step out.\"Webb emerged, naked.And officers rushed in, frantically looking for the little girl.At first, there was no sign of her.But suddenly, they found her buried in a clothes basket where he forced her to hide while threatening to kill her parents.\"Hey, here she is. Got her!\" an officer said. \"We got her. We got her.\"Officers arrested Webb in the hallway and carried the girl to safety in the parking lot where they called an ambulance.\"Come on, sweetheart. You are going to be OK,\" an officer told the girl.Earlier that night, a Forest Hill police sergeant searched that same hotel room but did not find the girl. He was later fired.Webb confessed to the crime and the jury took just 15 minutes to find him guilty.Webb still faces nine state charges of aggravated kidnapping, six counts  of aggravated sexual assault of a child (enhanced) and two counts of  indecency with a child (habitual offender notice).\n"

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\t\t    Die Digitalisierung als Wachstums- und Entwicklungstreiber zieht sich bereits heute durch fast alle Branchen und Anwendungsgebiete, sei es im Finanzbereich, der Industrie oder eben auch im Bereich Healthcare. Auch wenn nicht jedes Geschäftsmodell von Disruption bzw. Digital Darwinismus bedroht ist, bieten neue Technologien Potenziale für mehr Effizienz, bessere Prozesse und zur Kostenersparnis.\n\nIm Bereich der Gesundheitsversorgung in Krankenhäusern ist dieser Aspekt ein besonders wichtiger. Durch die Festlegung von Fallpauschalen und Sonderentgelten besteht ein hoher Kostendruck. Der Bedarf an mehr Effizienz durch Digitalisierung bleibt nicht nur wünschenswert, er ist zwingend notwendig. Damit das gelingt, ist der Einsatz von geeigneten interoperablen Lösungen entscheidend. Das Thema mit dem höchsten Potenzial aber auch mit den meisten Hindernissen wird seit Jahren intensiv diskutiert: Die elektronische Patientenakte (ePA)\nStatus Quo\nAnaloge Prozesse\nIn Deutschland liegen Patientendaten in internen Systemen vor – Sei es in Krankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) oder im Praxisverwaltungssystem (PVS) niedergelassener Ärzte. Auch die Dokumentation von weiteren Befunden ist in der Regel ein manueller Vorgang. Zwischen einzelnen Leistungserbringern werden Patienteninformationen, Befunde, Röntgenbilder teils digital, z.B. durch einrichtungsinterne Informationssysteme, aber auch analog in Form der Fieberkurve in der Behandlungskette weitergereicht. Handschriftliche Dokumentationen und postalischer Versand und Empfang sind fehleranfällig. Behandelnde Mediziner sind dabei nicht immer auf dem aktuellsten Stand, erhalten wichtige Patientendaten gar nicht oder zu spät und müssen Zeit für die Konsultation mit Kollegen aufwenden. Langwierige Behandlungszeiträume aber auch doppelt geführte oder unvollständige Patientenakten sind die Folge. Durch unnötige Überbehandlung und Dokumentation sowie Behandlungsfehler entstehen so jährlich Kosten in Milliardenhöhe.\nEinrichtungsübergreifende Intransparenzen\nAufgrund des medizinischen Fortschritts sind Behandlungszentren und Einrichtungen aber auch die einzelnen Berufsgruppen im Gesundheitswesen hochdifferenziert. Je nach Diagnose und Krankheitsbild werden Untersuchungen und Therapien für Patienten in arbeitsteiligen, teils parallel ablaufenden Prozessen und über mehrere Fachkliniken, Fachbereiche und Akteure abgebildet. Die so entstehenden Versorgungsketten sind zwischen den Einrichtungen nur lose bis gar nicht verzahnt, so dass es zu Brüchen in der Informationskette und Intransparenzen kommt. Das unzureichende oder fehlende Wissen über den aktuellen Behandlungs- und Gesundheitsstatus eines Patienten erschwert die weitere Behandlung und wirkt sich negativ auf die Patientensicherheit und die Kosteneffizenz der Leistungserbringer aus. Durch fehlende Interoperabilität zwischen den unterschiedlichen Informationssystemen sind Gesundheitseinrichtungen, Ärzte und Patienten digital voneinander entkoppelt.\nDer Patient als Informationsquelle und -Verteiler\nDurch die fehlende Synchronisation von Patientendaten zwischen verschiedenen Einrichtungen in der Versorgungskette kommt dem Patienten eine besondere Rolle als Informationsübermittler zu. Einerseits muss er möglichst lückenlos über seine bisherige Krankengeschichte (je nach Fall über mehrere Jahre in die Vergangenheit) berichten können aber auch medizinisches Fachpersonal hinsichtlich bestehender Vorerkrankungen, Medikation, Unverträglichkeiten, Allergien, etc. aufklären können. Gerade bei älteren oder geistig beeinträchtigten Patienten sind Informationslücken oft unvermeidlich. Zusätzlich werden Dokumente wie Arztbriefe oder Ergebnisse aus bildgebenden Verfahren dem Patienten bei der Entlassung/Überstellung persönlich mitgegeben. Damit trägt der Patient auch selbst ein unnötig hohes Maß an Verantwortung für einen optimalen Behandlungsverlauf und dessen Dauer.\nDie elektronische Patientenakte (ePA) soll diesen Herausforderungen begegnen und bildet aktuell das Kernthema in deutschen Krankenhäusern und Pflegeeinrichtungen in puncto Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens.\nDie elektronische Patientenakte – viele Modelle und kaum Vernetzung\nAktuelle Situation\nBereits 2004 mit dem GKV-Modernisierungsgesetz wurde die ePA als eine der Anwendungen der elektronischen Gesundheitskarte (eGK) genannt. Seit dem wurde mehr als eine Milliarde Euro in das Projekt investiert und noch immer nutzen Patienten in Deutschland keine elektronische Gesundheitskarte.\nIn dem 2015 verabschiedeten E-Health-Gesetz wurde die ePA als wesentlicher Teil der künftigen Telematikinfrastruktur (TI) genannt. Die TI, welche von der Betriebsgesellschaft gematik entwickelt wird, soll dabei das digitale Kommunikationsnetz und die Grundlage für die ePA und das elektronische Patientenfach bilden. Bis zum 01.01.2019 sollen alle Ärzte, Psychotherapeuten, Krankenhäuser und anderen Akteure des Gesundheitswesens daran angebunden sein. \nLaut Gesetz soll die ePA den Not­fall­daten­satz, den Medikationsplan, Arztbriefe und weitere medizinische Dokumente, wie etwa den elektronischen Impfpass, aufnehmen.\nAnders als das ebenfalls vorgesehene ePF, erfordert die ePA als Zugriffsberechtigung den elektronischen Heilberufsausweis des behandelnden Arztes. Im ePF wiederrum sollen dem Versicherten die Inhalte seiner Patientenakte in ein sogenanntes Patientenfach gespiegelt werden, damit der Patient auch unabhängig von einem Arztbesuch darauf zugreifen kann. Über die Daten der Akte hinaus, soll der Patient hier auch die Möglichkeit erhalten, persönliche Gesundheitsdaten einzutragen. \nMit einheitlichen Standards und Spezifikationen sollen Insellösungen vermieden werden. Im E-Health Gesetz ist davon allerdings nichts zu lesen. Dafür existierten heute bereits parallel verschiedene gesetzliche Grundlagen zur Umsetzung von elektronischen Akten:\n\nIn § 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 4 SGB V - elektronische Patientenakte\nin § 291a Absatz 3 Nr. 5 SGB V - elektronisches Patientenfach\nin § 68 SGB V - elektronische Gesundheitsakte\nin § 630f BGB – elektronische Arztakte\n\nMilliardenschwere Digitalprojekte auf Basis von confusion-by-design haben es schwer. Daher ist es auch nicht verwunderlich, dass bereits ein E-Health Gesetz II in Arbeit ist. In der Zwischenzeit haben bereits einige Versicherer Ihre eigenen Pilotprojekte in Betrieb genommen. Natürlich mit unterschiedliche Strategien und mit unterschiedlichen Varianten der elektronischen Patientenakte.\nVarianten von Patientenakten \n\nEinrichtungsübergreifende Patientenakte (eEPA) Bei diesem Konzept werden alle Informationen die bei der Behandlungen eines Patienten anfallen für Gesundheitsversorgungseinrichtungen fallübergreifend hinweg bereitgestellt. Eintragungen erfolgen ausschließlich über Ärzte und ähnliche Behandlungsmitglieder. Die Akte wird dauerhaft geführt, so dass eine gesamtheitliche Versorgung des Patienten über alle bisherigen oder bestehenden Krankheiten möglich ist. Einträge können von Leistungserbringern über ein Portal oder über das Primärsystem heraus an die eEPA übermittelt werden – Die Interoperabilität zwischen den Systemen vorausgesetzt. Die eEPA sieht abseits von der Datenfreigabe keine Einsicht oder Mitwirkung durch den Patienten selbst vor.\n\n\n\nElektronische Fallakte (eFA)Die eFA ist ärztlich geführt und moderiert. Sie wird einrichtungsübergreifend eingesetzt und ausschließlich fallbezogen geführt. Die eFA hat zum Ziel, eine optimale Koordination der Versorgung in den einzelnen Behandlungseinrichtungen zu ermöglichen. Im Gegensatz zur eEPA wird sie nach Fallabschluss geschlossen, der Lebenszyklus der Akte fällt dementsprechend kurz aus. Die Daten in der eFA werden über die Primärsysteme zur Verfügung gestellt. Auch hier gibt der Patient seine Einwilligung über die Datennutzung generell, ein Zugriff auf Patientenseite findet nicht statt.\n\n\nPersönliche, einrichtungsübergreifende Gesundheits- und Patientenakte (PEPA)Dieses Konzept bindet den Patienten bei der Bereitstellung, Einsicht und Freigabe von Gesundheitsdaten aktiv mit ein. Über ein Patientenportal hat der Patient die Möglichkeit z.B. Arztbriefe selbstständig einzustellen (Patienten-Selbstmanagement). Auch hat der Patient die Möglichkeit selbst zu bestimmen, welche Daten in der Akte gespeichert werden und wer darauf Zugriff haben soll. Die PEPA ist wie die ePA eine fallübergreifende bzw. lebenslange Akte und wird sowohl vom Patienten als auch Ärzten dezentral oder über angebundene Primärsysteme gepflegt. \n\n\n\nElektronische Gesundheitsakte (eGA) Die elektronische Gesundheitsakte wird häufig mit der elektronischen Patientenakte gleichgesetzt. Da letztere aber bis auf die PEPA rein ärztlich geführt ist, ist die eGA so ausgelegt, dass der Patient alleiniger Herr seiner Daten ist und diese beliebig anreichern kann. Versicherte sollen selbst entscheiden können, welche Diagnosen oder Medikamente sie darauf speichern möchten und wem sie Einsicht gewähren wollen. Voraussetzung ist, dass die eGA das Erheben, Verarbeiten und Nutzen von Daten über Befunde, Diagnosen, Therapien, Behandlungsberichte sowie Impfungen für eine fall- und einrichtungsübergreifende Dokumentation über den Patienten unterstützt\n\nTechnische Standards\nAus der Notwendigkeit einer einheitlichen Kommunikation und der Herstellung von Interoperabilität, haben sich verschiedene Standards entwickelt, die den technischen Kontext für elektronische Patientenakten bilden.\n\nIntegrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHR)IHE ist eine internationale, gemeinnützige Initiative aus Industrie und Fachanwendern, die sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat, die Interoperabilität zwischen IT-Systemen im Gesundheitswesen sicherzustellen. Die von IHE entwickelten Standards (IHE-Profile) unterstützen eine Vielzahl klinischer Prozesse und enthalten auch optionale Funktionen und sind bestimmten Domänen z.B. für Augenheilkunde, Radiologie, Technische Infrastruktur, etc. zugeordnet. Für den Einsatz von elektronischen Patientenakten ist das IHE Profil XDS (Cross-Enterprise Dokument Sharing) hervorzuheben, welches eine standardisierte Spezifikation für die gemeinsame, einrichtungsübergreifende Nutzung von Dokumenten beschreibt. \n\n\nHL7 HL7 ist, ähnlich wie IHR, eine internationale Gruppe, die einheitliche Standards für den Datenaustausch zwischen verschiedenen Gesundheitsinstitutionen- und Systemen entwickelt. Die entwickelten Normen haben die Interoperabilität von verschiedenen Herstellern und Betreibern zum Ziel z.B. zwischen Krankenhausinformationssystemen (KIS) und Praxisverwaltungssystemen (PVS) niedergelassener Ärzte. Der aktuellste Standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) vereinigt die Vorteile der etablierten HL7-Standard-Produktlinien und aktuellen Web-Standards (z.B. XML, JSON, ATOM, HTTPS, OAuth) und legt Wert auf einfache Implementierbarkeit und unterstützt die Entwicklung von mobile und cloud-basierte Anwendungen.\nDICOM® DICOM® steht für Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine und ist der internationale Standard zum Übertragen, Speichern, Abrufen, Drucken, Verarbeiten und Anzeigen von medizinischen Bildinformationen. Die meisten Hersteller von Systeme für bildgebende Verfahren wie Röntgen, MRT, CT haben den Standard in ihren Produkten implementiert. Dadurch wird eine hohe Interoperabilität im Umfeld verschiedener Gesundheitseinrichtungen ermöglicht. DICOM bildet auch die Grundlage für die digitale Bildarchivierungsystemen sog. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS).\n\nAktuelle Praxisbeispiele\nVivy-App\nDie vom gleichnamigen Unternehmen entwickelte App „Vivy“ wurde in Kooperation von 90 gesetzlichen Krankenkassen und vier privaten Krankenversicherungen auf den Weg gebracht. Die in einem deutschen Rechenzentrum gespeicherten Daten sind Ende-zu-Ende verschlüsselt und können über ein gekoppeltes Smartphone mit 2-Faktor-Authentifizierung vom Patienten eingesehen werden. Die App ermöglicht den Upload von medizinischen Daten und Dokumenten. Die App soll nicht nur die Gesundheitsakte sondern zudem den Impfpass, den Medikationsplan, Notfalldaten, einen  Gesundheits-Check sowie eine Arztsuche beinhalten. Mittels Barcode-Scan von Medikamenten sollen auch mögliche Wechselwirkungen aufgezeigt werden. Da die App das DICOM-Format beherrscht, können auch Daten wie aus bildgebenden Verfahren importiert werden. Der Patient entscheidet, welche Informationen er mit Ärzten und Gesundheitseinrichtungen teilt und kann auch Dokumente löschen. Beim Verlust des Schlüssel sind die Daten allerdings unwiederbringlich verloren. Vivy soll als persönliche Gesundheitsassistent-App für 25 Mio. Versicherte kostenfrei zur Verfügung gestellt werden. \nTK-Safe – Techniker Krankenkasse\nEin ähnliches Konzept wie Vivy stellte Ende April die Techniker Krankenkasse mit ihrer bundesweiten elektronische Gesundheitsakte (eGA) namens TK-Safe vor. Die zusammen mit IBM entwickelte eGA ermöglicht es den Versicherten, alle der TK vorliegenden Daten über ihr Smartphone in ihre Akte zu laden. Dazu zählen Impfungen, verordnete Medikamente, ärztliche Diagnosen oder auch Röntgenbilder oder Entlassungsdokumente. Die Daten werden zentral Secure Cloud von IBM in Frankfurt am Main gespeichert und sind Ende-zu-Ende verschlüsselt. Zur Sicherheitsinfrastruktur gehört eine Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung aus regis­triertem Smartphone und Passworteingabe, bevor der Versicherte in seine eGA gelangt. Auch hier bedeutet der Verlust des Schlüssel einen unweigerlichen Verlust der Daten.Weder die TK noch IBM haben Zugriff auf die Daten und der Patient allein entscheidet ob und ich welchem Umfang ärztliches Personal darauf Zugriff erhalten.\nBislang werden die Daten bei Versicherungswechsel oder bei 12-monatiger Nichtnutzung nach 28 Tagen gelöscht. Perspektivisch soll es aber auch möglich sein, die Daten zu anderen Versicherung mitzunehmen. Eine spätere Anbindung an die Telematikinfrastruktur ist geplant. TK-Safe soll künftig mit dem elektronischen Patientenfach kompatibel sein. Das Partnernetzwerk umfasst 16 Kliniken und Betreibergesellschaften wie Agaplesion, die Helios Kliniken, Vivantes und dem Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf. TK-Safe steht bundesweit ca. 10 Mio. Versicherten zur Verfügung.\nPEPA – Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg (UKHD)\nDas Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg bietet bereits seit 2014 eine persönliche, einrichtungsübergreifende Gesundheits- und Patientenakte für Patienten im Rhein-Neckar-Raum an. Relevante Dokumente und Bilddaten können über standardisierte Schnittstellen Die Primärsysteme der teilnehmenden Einrichtungen werden auf Basis internationaler und offener Standards (HL7, DICOM) sowie Profile (IHE) in die PEPA für die Übermittlung von Inhalten integriert. Voraussetzung dafür ist die Einwilligung des Patienten. Die Einwilligung erfolgt direkt vor Ort im jeweiligen System des Kooperationspartners (Krankenhausinformationssystem oder Praxisverwaltungssystem). Auf diese Weise kann der Patient für jede Einrichtung separat entscheiden, ob und wem er Zugriff auf seine Gesundheitsdaten ermöglichen möchte. Sämtliche Daten liegen auf gesicherten Servern des UKHD. Über das persönliche Patientenportal können Nutzer auf Ihre PEPA jederzeit zugreifen, Zugriffsfreigaben managen und sehen wer die Daten verwendet hat. Zusätzlich sind im Portal zertifizierte Informationsmaterialien abrufbar, die dabei helfen komplexe Befunde zu verstehen. Features wie ein Medikationsplan oder die Möglichkeit ein Sport- oder Schmerztagebuch zu führen sind ebenfalls integriert. Fragebögen für Forschungszwecke können auch direkt über das Smartphone beantwortet werden, sofern der Patient hierfür seine Einwilligung erteilt. Künftig soll die PEPA auch mit der eGA TK-Safe vernetzt werden, so dass die Daten zwischen den Systemen ausgetauscht werden können. An die PEPA sind aktuell das UKHD und die Thoraxklinik Heidelberg sowie regionale Praxen angeschlossen. Das Krankenhaus Salem in Heidelberg und das Kreiskrankenhaus Bergstraße sind in Vorbereitung für eine Anbindung.\nFazit\nAktuell tritt genau das ein, was von Seiten der Politik, Spitzenverbänden aus Medizin und Versicherern und Ärzteschaft vermieden werden sollte: Die Entstehung von Insellösungen. Durch fehlende Spezifikationen, langwierige Entwicklungsprozesse bei der TI, ePA/ePF und fehlende gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen entwickeln Akteure im Gesundheitswesen und Ihre Partner eigene Lösungen. \nEine übergreifende Interoperabilität zwischen den Systemen scheint aber noch in weiter Ferne, vor allem da noch viele Versicherer keine eigene ePA-Strategie entwickelt haben und die künftige Telematikinfrastruktur weiter auf sich warten lässt. Bei über 70 Mio. gesetzlich Versicherter in Deutschland erreichen die bisherigen Konzepte daher noch nicht einmal die Hälfte aller möglichen Nutzer in Deutschland. Auf der anderen Seite darf für Kliniken und Ärzte die Dokumentation in der ePA zu keinem bürokratischen Mehraufwand führen, was eine tiefe Integration in die genutzten Primärsysteme erfordert. Bislang können diese entscheiden, auf welches Konzept sie mit aufspringen wollen. Ob sich dieses am Ende durchsetzt bzw. für einen übergreifenden Datenaustausch verfügbar, bleibt offen. Die Auswahl der \"richtigen\" Lösung ist damit entscheidend für den Einstieg in die digitale Patientenakte und für nachhaltige Kostenersparnisse im Gesundheitssektor.\n\n                         \n\t\t\t\t\n"

FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., November 18, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index was little changed, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell and the Nasdaq rose, all having hit record intraday highs earlier in the session. Traders cited the lingering uncertainty over whether the United States and China could agree to end a near 1-1/2 year trade war as a reason for stocks to drift and bond prices to go higher. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no deal is reached with Beijing to end the trade war. The next round of tariffs is due to start in mid-December. Oil fell after sources told Reuters that Russia is unlikely to agree to cut its oil output further at a meeting with fellow exporters next month. Separately, Norway’s October oil production beat forecasts and the potential oversupply, combined with some worries over global demand next year, sent prices lower. “Moreover, Russia also failed to fulfill its agreed cuts in November so far,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 3.38% to $55.12 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $60.73, down 2.74% on the day. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 102.2 points, or 0.36%, to 27,934.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.85 points, or 0.06%, to 3,120.18 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.72 points, or 0.24%, to 8,570.66. Hopes of a trade truce earlier in the day drove European stocks to a four-year high and a measure of world stock markets to their highest in nearly two years, but those gains were pared later in the session.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 0.12% while  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.02% eking out its seventh straight session of gains. Emerging market stocks rose 0.48%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.68% higher, while Japan’s Nikkei futures NKc1 lost 0.66%. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields slipped as risk appetite weakened. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.786%, down from 1.808% late on Monday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 29/32 in price to yield 2.252%, from 2.293% late on Monday. The dollar was little changed against a basket of six major currencies. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.05%, with the euro EUR= up 0.05% to $1.1075. While the dollar was supported by recent U.S. economic data meeting lowered expectations, the greenback may be in for some weakness, said Juan Perez, senior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc. “Central banks cannot provide that much to incentivize stocks any higher, thus risk-appetite is muted and the buck may continue to lose based on the fact that the American economy is indeed slower and the Fed’s ability to satisfy anyone is in question,” Perez said. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.13% versus the greenback at 108.55 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2925, down 0.21% on the day.     Spot gold XAU= added 0.1% to $1,472.19 an ounce.  Copper CMCU3 rose 0.86% to $5,880.00 a tonne.     Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3 lost 0.06% to $1,737.00 a tonne.

        "articleBody": "\nNEW DELHI: Their American dream shattered and huge savings wasted, nearly 150 Indians returned home broke on Wednesday after being deported for either violating visa norms or illegally entering the United States. As they stepped outside the airport, one after the other, they appeared sad. Some said they felt dejected that they could not realise their American dream even after several attempts.\n“This was the fourth time I have been deported,” said Singh Jabarjung, 24, from Punjab’s Bhatinda.\n“I boarded a flight on May 15 and reached Mexico via Moscow and Paris. From there, I tried to enter California on May 16 but was caught by police and deported from Arizona,” he said.\nHe said he has spent Rs 24 lakh in the four attempts and Rs 40 lakh on advocacy. Lakshiwnder Singh, another deportee, said he had given Rs 25 lakh to an Amritsar-based agent to help him enter the US. “He sent me to Mexico on May 2 via Moscow and Paris. They caught me while I was trying to cross the border and deported here from Arizona in US,” he said.\nThe special aircraft carrying the deportees landed at the T3 terminal of the Delhi airport at 6am, an airport official said. The aircraft reached India via Bangladesh. Following paper work with the immigration department, the deportees have started coming out of the airport. These 150 Indians have either violated their visa norms or were illegal immigrants, the officials said.\nOn October 18, more than 300 Indians, including one woman, were deported by Mexican immigration authorities for illegally entering the country to sneak into the US.

        "articleBody": "The big iFixit teardown is done, and the results are in. The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a heck of a lot like the old 15-inch MacBook Pro, save for a few meaningful throwback features. Yes, I mean throwback as in retro—as in Apple actually took retired features from old MacBooks and reintroduced them as new features. It would seem that the future of innovation at the Cupertino-based computer company is what I’ll call rewind design.I’m not complaining. The 16-inch MacBook Pro looks like a hell of a laptop, as it should for a starting price of $2,400. The new machine comes with a bigger display, a bigger battery, better speakers, and a brand new AMD graphics card. Then there are those retro features. There’s a physical escape button just like there was on MacBook Pros before the rise of the Touch Bar. The arrow keys are once again arranged in an inverted “T” formation, as they had been on keyboards for decades. The new “Magic Keyboard” uses a scissor switch that’s almost identical to the Bluetooth-enabled Magic Keyboard that Apple released nearly five years ago. The keyboard thing is a big deal. Apple has been dealing with public outrage sparked by its newer butterfly mechanism in MacBook keyboards. This low-travel design contributed to the impossible thinness of the 12-inch MacBook released in 2015, before finding its way into all MacBook models in 2016. Even a small bit of dust or debris could disable a key, and fixing it required replacing the entire upper half of the laptop. Apple admitted to the flawed design and launched a limited repair program in June 2018, before it ultimately offered free keyboard repairs for all MacBooks with the new mechanism. The company was still trying to fix the scissor design as recently as May of this year when it launched an updated 15-inch MacBook Pro. Now, the cursed butterfly-powered MacBook keyboard is all but dead. The new keyboard design is expected to show up on smaller MacBooks in early 2020.But the new design isn’t all that new. As iFixit points out in its teardown, the 16-inch MacBook’s keyboard is virtually identical to the well-loved Magic Keyboard from 2o15. In other words, Apple replaced a flawed design from 2015—one that it had tried and failed to perfect many times—with a design from 2015 that wasn’t so flawed. It’s almost as if Apple made the wrong decision almost five years ago, and in order to deal with that, it’s just going back in time and making the right decision. The same is true for the new physical escape button, which Apple had axed on most MacBook Pro models in 2016, and for the new inverted “T” arrow key layout, which Apple had done away with back in 2015.This is a curious way to design computers. It also seems like Apple’s MacBook team was really screwing up back in 2015. That was a time when the company’s design team decided to fix a few things that weren’t broken and break a few more things in the process. Now, to fix those problems, Apple is just replacing the broken new things with near-identical versions of the old things, effectively putting its design process in reverse. If you liked the crispiness and ease of the newer scissor mechanism on the big MacBook Pro, too bad. Apple failed at perfecting its promising design so it just switched back to the old one.Once again, I’m not complaining. As one of the many thousands of people with broken MacBook keyboards, I welcome the return of the more robust design of the Magic Keyboard. I have one of the old Magic Keyboards on my desk, and I love it! I especially love how the keys don’t break constantly. And while we’re on the topic, I also miss having an escape key. My 15-inch MacBook Pro has a Touch Bar, which I hate—although I would hate it slightly less if it had a physical escape key. I’m honestly impartial on the inverted “T” arrow key thing, but I know some people are passionate about it.What does bug me about Apple’s new take on innovation is that it confirms the belief that the company seldom has new ideas. I wrote a long rant about this last year when it was apparent that Apple focuses less on hardware innovation and more on money-making services. That prediction, unfortunately, turned out to be true. In recent months, we’ve seen the release of a new iPhone, which amounted to the old iPhone plus an extra camera, as well as the new Apple TV+ streaming service, which is a bit bland. They’re not bad products. But they’re certainly not groundbreaking.The same appears to be true for the 16-inch MacBook Pro. I’ll reserve final judgment until I’ve had time to test the new laptop, and given my penchant for an operational keyboard and an escape key, I bet I’ll like it. I just can’t stop wondering if I’ll ever see another new Apple product that warps my understanding of technology the way that the iPod or the iPhone did so many years ago. It’s possible that Apple will do it with some sort of augmented reality headset in the next couple of years. Maybe its designers have been so busy working on that futuristic product that they couldn’t focus on perfecting keyboard design. Surely they’ve been busy doing better things.\n"

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven if its core components are owed to other games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order finds a reason for their inclusion and stops just short of greatness.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is game that is many things to different people. You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of climbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan your next jump.\nIt’s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking, dodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it’s even Star Wars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally ancient tombs.\nWhere it’s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I instead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other games and presenting them in a coherent way.\nFallen Order’s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding as a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge of the Jedi. The game’s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the prequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era’s biggest moments is enough to get you on board with the premise.\nOne of the narrative’s strongest elements is that it doesn’t rely on iconic characters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan are briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction tends to bring to their appearances. There’s one exception to that towards the very end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-executed, but ultimately doesn’t matter to the general story.\nAfter hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the Force, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly adorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them use Greez’s ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With the exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time to grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in bleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year’s best new character. \nI have to give special attention to his voice direction – and my god, every little animation he plays – both of which build up his character as an inquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial robots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2’s BT-7274.\nThe general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to obtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find said civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little bearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn’t so much the need to get the things, as it was to spend more time with these incredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\n\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways. Taking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will only be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes require a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\nThis means you’ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets even as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn’t shy about sending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the next, but you don’t always need to follow the quest marker if you don’t want to.\nI visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just by exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that enemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I managed to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different point through normal story progression, so it’s great to see Respawn offer players the freedom to obtain it so early.\nAs more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated mess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It’s not as elegant as you might find in FromSoftware’s work, which is what makes the map – available to you at any point – such a lifesaver.\nThe map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible and which aren’t. They’re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked off require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It’s a more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake’s map, and alleviates some of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous levels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems entirely, but one doesn’t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend minutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and watch a cutscene.\nIn your adventures, you’ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The wildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they’re often in groups, and have harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in a single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a bigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers, however – units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\nThose not only offer the biggest challenge, they’re mostly armed with melee weapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more manageable.\n\nThe best new character in 2019.\n\nFallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three together, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these sort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\nYou’re going to parry the basic trooper’s bolts back at them, killing them in one hit. You’ll watch for the melee trooper’s very obvious tells to also get rid of them very quickly, and you’ll use whatever Force powers you might have to push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the crowd. After all is said and done, you’ll be left with one or two Purge Troopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious. \nI understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out the power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on Master), you’re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as you would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone playing The Force Unleashed 2019.\nA better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the lower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would love to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to get stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\nFallen Order’s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its own rules. You don’t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy essentially forever, although most enemies can block.\nYou and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are blocked. After it depletes, you’ll need to disengage until it recharges, or go on the offensive. It’s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-stepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where it falters is the execution. \nEnemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through your roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you’ll begin defaulting to just holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable, but it’s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll through and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some consistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\nAnother problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time it right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a fight. There’s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you pull one off. Your opponents’ guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment as a result of the parry. \nFallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into the blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can’t cancel into a parry. This caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing right. By the same token, enemies don’t really care about your parries, save for bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They’ll often continue their combo unabated and you’ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren’t working.\nOver time, I realised that the animation simply isn’t fast enough to keep up with enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and blocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I found that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often easier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that window to attack. \nThese little inconsistencies add up, and could’ve soured me on the game if Force powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn’t hook me. \n\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in traversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the limited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the aforementioned combat could all – at the game’s worst moments – lead to frustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those edges, and it may get there eventually – but right now, lack of polish is holding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren’t enough to knock down my enjoyment, and I’ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to players on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident, focused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don’t always win. \nThe action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired by, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting – but Respawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside those hallowed inspirations.\nAnd yes, it doesn’t always get there in this one, but damn If I can’t help but respect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are serviceable, and best moments are memorable. It’s worth experiencing by Star Wars fans hungry for an original story that doesn’t settle for trite, and action game players looking for a decent – albeit flawed – combat.\nVersion tested: PC.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"

        "articleBody": " \n                The equity benchmark Sensex scaled a new all-time high of 40,816.38 in the morning trade on November 20. Not just the Sensex, even the Nifty has been rallying at a time when concerns over the Indian economy are growing, with macroeconomic data pointing to a slowdown.Why is the market behaving differently from the economy?\"Markets usually run ahead of macros and price future growth. There are three positive indicators for growth – reduction in the corporate tax rate, proposed divestment of large public sector units and a possible resolution of the US-China trade impasse. Therefore, we see growth coming back in 2020. Now, we expect broader markets to outperform,\" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL Securities.Experts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a recovery in the economy.            related news      \"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a reasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities.A key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings.The September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of the companies reported in-line or better than expected results.Tax cuts have positively impacted the earnings in the higher tax bracket. The key positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front (sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely neutral, say experts.\"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate tax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.For the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the concerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.Bank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza attributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Essar Steel resolution.\"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should be seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in bidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will be high now,\" said Oza.Global financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the Essar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured banks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries.Near-term consolidation likelyHungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don't grow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as distorted by a misconception.\"The hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings should not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several structural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or investment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the high government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.An extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent revival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.Coming back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the market and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is a stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the benchmark.\"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally. So far, it looks fair as it is following the directional cues,\" he said.The valuation of the market is also a point that experts highlight.The Indian market’s high valuations are being supported by a combination of factors, including low global and domestic bond yields, expectations of a China-US trade deal, expectations of further reforms in India and Street's expectations of a strong earnings recovery over FY2020-22.\"We see risks to all these points and thus, any negative changes to the market’s expectations, especially related to further reforms in India and strong earnings recovery, could disappoint the market,\" Kotak Institutional Equities said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\n\t\tÂ \n\n\t\tReview\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tWelcome to the new 16-inch MacBook Pro. While it looks quite familiar, Apple's new flagship laptop moves the needle forward in a big way. We've spent the last several days taking the new Pro for a spin and can say that Apple has dutifully listened to users' feedback this time around. Let's talk about it.Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pro\nWe're not certain when Apple last issued four updates to the MacBook Pro within 18 months, or to any laptop it has ever produced. But, here we are.\nJust months after the last i9 MacBook Pro was released, Apple has unveiled its 16-inch MacBook Pro. The surface changes aren't even obvious â€” the monitor is about a half an inch larger on the diagonal, and you can't even tell that the machine is larger than the 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro design.\nInterestingly, it is actually smaller and thinner than the 2012 through 2015 model. You also can't tell unless you're looking at the three together.\nThere are three main configurations of the 15-inch MacBook Pro, one with a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 processor, a 2.3GHz i9 model, and a 2.4GHz i9 configuration â€”effectively the same options as the 15-inch MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019. Depending on model, there are options for a AMD Radeon Pro 5300M or 5500M. For this review, we're examining the 2.4GHz 16-inch MacBook Pro, with 512GB of flash storage, 32GB of RAM, and the Radeon Pro 5500M. The retail price on this configuration is $3,299.16-inches instead of 15.4\nThis will matter to you a great deal, or it won't, and even before you started reading this, you already knew if it mattered to you or not. In our eyes, there are more important aspects to the 16-inch MacBook Pro redesign than the screen, though.\nWhat we will say, is if you are staring at a 15-inch MacBook Pro right next to the 16-inch MacBook Pro you will notice a difference. The updated design looks better with slimmer bezels and an ever-so-slightly elevated pixel density going from 220 to 226ppi. That likely won't be a huge reason for users to upgrade though.The slimmer bezels of the 16-inch MacBook Pro\nPros out there who are well-versed in the video space will appreciate one change to the display though, which is the ability to specifically choose your refresh rate. Heading to System Preferences, multiple options can be chosen from to best align with your work.Keyboard\nKeyboards are highly subjective. So highly subjective, in fact, that even if you like a mechanical keyboard, there are dozens of different iterations, with different key feels because assorted manufacturers believe  that there is that much granularity in demand.\nSo, a little context is important. We're not giant fans of typing on glass, like the iPad. We didn't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard that was introduced with the 2016 MacBook Pro â€” but it wasn't a favorite of ours. Inverted 'T' design for arrow keys\nWe get that the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard design, and iterations, are polarizing. Where the 2012 through 2015 design had the entire expression of keyboard like and hate, the 2016 through 2019 weighed more heavily on the \"it'll do\" to \"this is terrible\" range, with very, very few folks in the \"this is great\" zone.\nIn regards to reliability, across the entire AppleInsider staff, exactly one unit had to be replaced. We had the same failure rate with the 2012 through 2015 keyboard. And, the data we've been collecting on the 2018 model and the mid-2019 refresh suggests that whatever Apple did for reliability is working, with it having an equivalent failure rate in the first year to the 2012 through 2015 design.\nBeyond looking back, the key actuation on the 16-inch MacBook Pro is punctuated by a soft click, most similar to the mid-2019 noise versus any other, if a bit quieter. Where the 2015 design noise was more from the key bottoming out the switch, if you press slowly, you can feel where the click is on the new computer, before hitting the bottom of the chamber. Gone is the clackety-clack of the original 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard, and you'll never mistake this keyboard for a desktop mechanical model.\nThere's more sensory data on the keys in the video that accompanies this piece. But, here are the numbers: the key travel on the 16-inch MacBook Pro keyboard is one millimeter. This is in comparison to between 0.6 and 0.7 millimeters on the 2016-style keyboard, and between 1.2 and 1.5 millimeters on the 2012 through 2015 style.Typing on the new MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard\nIn our testing, we had a baseline of 38 dBa of ambient noise measured with a Kanomax model 4431 audiometer, with the test gear at head height and distance. Typing on the 2016 MacBook Pro with no other CPU load brought that up to about 43 dBa. The highest we could manage on the 16-inch MacBook pro with a particularly angry bout of random key-mashing was 41 dBa. Quieter indeed.\nWith that 2016 redesign, Apple made a big deal about key stability being an underpinning of the design. In short, the new keyboard is more key travel than the 2016, but less than the 2012. Whatever Apple did for key stability in the 2016 was moved to the 16-inch MacBook pro â€” and this is a good thing. \nAnd, Apple tells us that individual keys can be replaced. We didn't get any information on what this entails, but at this juncture, it still looks like a complete disassembly is required to do so.Touch Bar and Escape Key\nThe new keyboard on the 16-inch MacBook Pro has a physical escape key, and instead of the Touch ID sensor being connected to the Touch Bar, it is in its own little well. Coders have been clamoring for the former, and we think that Apple did the latter to ease repair, if that sensor needs to be replaced.\nIn our use, a physical escape key makes little difference â€” but for coders, it's an entirely different story. We've been told about times where things have gone completely awry, and the virtual escape key on the Touch Bar doesn't work at all, forcing a hard reboot.\nAs a general rule, we like what the Touch Bar brings. After a lukewarm initial impression. we've adopted it into our workflows. We're not going to say that everybody is going to like it, but utilities like Better Touch Tool open up a frontier of customization options, and we recommend it to anybody that has a Touch Bar and wants to use it beyond the Apple-sanctioned or developer-mandated uses.Testing the silicon\nApple did include the same CPU options as the mid-2019 predecessors but thanks to its new internals, it is able to get slightly better performance out of the chips. When we compared the 16-inch base to the previous 15-inch base, we saw that single-core scores increased from 1061 to 1128 and multi-core scores increased from 5425 to 5641 on Geekbench 5.\nIn Cinebench R20, scores jumped as well from 2395 to 2623. This is due to the machine being able to keep those cores cooler for longer.\nRunning the Browserbench.org Speedometer test that measures web app performance on each machine, the new machine scored a 129 while the previous generation clocked in at a 126.8.GPU\nFor the GPU, we turned once more to our usual Unigine Heaven benchmark. Running at full screen, with tesselation and stereo turned off, at medium quality (our standard settings), the new machine earned an average of 86.6 frames per second and a 2182 score. It maxed out at an impressive 162.1 frames per second.Unigine Heaven benchmark results for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\nImpressively, that beats the VEGA 20 graphics from the previous design which earned a total score of 2072 and a max FPS of 147.4. It also won on average FPS over the previous 82.3. Again, that is our base model compared to the previous high-end selection.\nIn another benchmark to test the performance of Metal, we ran the Geekbench 5 Compute test. The new base machine managed a 21757 while the previous base garnered only a 13919.\nLastly, we performed an export test. Exporting the same 4K 24FPS Final Cut Pro X project from both base units with the same settings. Final Cut was updated  The previous generation took 4 minutes and 15 seconds while the updated machine did the export in only 2 minutes and 38 seconds.Thermals\nThe 2018 15-inch i9 MacBook Pro was a very hot machine. While it still holds up, Apple has improved the situation greatly with the 16-inch MacBook pro.\nEight cores are hot. The 5500M chipset is toasty, and the RAM is too.\nIn our use, when the 2018 i9 MacBook Pro was under load, the keyboard's metal surface routinely hit 107 degrees Fahrenheit around the G, H, and J keys. That's still usable, but it is very, very warm. On the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, that area is still the hotspot, but it hit a maximum of 89 degrees while running under load.\nThere are still a large number of picky details to examine with the 16-inch MacBook Pro in regards to the thermal environment. We'll be looking a lot more at varying work environments including ambient temperature effects, and machine orientations as the weeks and months wear on to see if they make any difference at all to performance.\nBut, we're not expecting to see much difference this time around.\nIn regards to the revamped cooling system. Apple says that the 16-inch MacBook Pro has different fan blades and more surface area on all heat exchanging surfaces. This means that the computer sounds different under load.\nStrictly from a noise standpoint, in the same 38 dBA room, the 2016 MacBook Pro under heavy load is about 45 dBa at the same range that we did the keyboard testing. The 16-inch MacBook Pro hit a maximum of 44 dBa, with equivalent fan speeds to the 2016 model.\nThe MacBook Pro for the last seven years has sounded about the same. It's hard to describe how it sounds now, but there's a lower pitch and a different warble to the fans now, likely because of the new blade shape. You'll notice the difference if you're a long-time user, but it isn't distracting, and you'll forget the old sound pretty quickly.Using Final Cut Pro X on the new MacBook Pro\nWe've only just started testing and thermal performance. Our initial testing suggests that the 16-inch MacBook Pro can maintain a higher clock speed for longer â€” which isn't well-reflected in benchmark testing to date. \nThe fans on the new MacBook Pro start to get audible in that 38 dBa office environment at about 83 degrees Celsius processor temperature. Based on observation, they start to pick up speed at about 75C â€” earlier than the 80C that the 2016 through 2019 MacBook Pro start to ramp up. We'll be testing this more in the future.\nThe efficacy of this thermal redesign in regards to your own workflow will vary very much depending on your individual workload. But, using a utility that turns off the boost feature on the processor essentially guarantees a silent machine with next to no fan noise, at a cost of taking about one and a half times longer to complete your job. We'll be talking about this in the future too.Flash speeds are still blistering\nThe drive is absolutely no slouch. Running the BlackMagic disk speed test after the machine had been indexing for two days, we saw a write speed of 2890 megabytes per second, and a read speed of 3150 megabytes per second on both a 512GB and 1TB model.\nThis is a bit faster than the i9 MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019, and about 350MB per second faster than the 2018 MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage or more.Battery lifeBattery is improved on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\nThis time Apple baked in a new 100Wh battery that is necessary for the beefed-up internals. That new battery doesn't just match the last model's performance, it extends it. While we didn't have too much of a chance to surf the web for 11 hours on end, Apple says that is what you can expect â€” which is one hour more than the 15-inch offered.Speakers\nWe didn't expect much change when it came to speakers, but after trying them out we were wowed.\nMoving between listening to our above test playlist reserved for speakers and headphones as well as Apple TV+ content with Dolby Atmos, it makes listening to content on a portable machine far more enjoyable.There are six speakers in the new MacBook Pro\nBass was substantial, but thanks to the dual force-canceling drivers, it doesn't cause the machine to shake or feel uncomfortable at loud volumes.\nThe biggest note was how much larger and fuller the soundstage appeared as we listening to content from one machine to the other.Wi-Fi 6\nOddly, Apple has a few omissions with the pro machine. The FaceTime camera is still capped at a meager 720p. But more frustrating, Apple has felt the need to hold back with 801.11ac Wi-Fi rather than jump to Wi-Fi 6 ax as we saw with the most recent iPhone launch.\nConsidering a Mac is intended to be a portable machine, the lack of the latest Wi-Fi tech is frustrating. Users rightly expect to pick up a Mac and use it for several years and investing in a new machine shouldn't be capped by previous standards. Especially one Apple has already adopted en masse with millions of iPhones.\nWi-Fi 6 is still launching and there is only a smattering of ax routers on the market so looking at today's landscape users aren't missing out, but they will when they have this machine in two-three years and Wi-Fi 6 has been more widely adopted.\nThere will certainly be some iPhone 11 Pro users who will jump on board with Wi-Fi 6 early to take advantage of it on their phones that will be left behind with the new MacBook Pro in that regard.Still four Thunderbolt 3\nApple has now redesigned the MacBook Pro, listening to pro users, and the HDMI port has not returned. Thunderbolt 3 is staying. It's past time to come to terms and deal with it.Still four Thunderbolt 3 ports\nThe USB-C physical connector on Thunderbolt 3 is not the end of the world, but it is an adjustment for users, if you're coming from a 2015 or older MacBook Pro. Complaints that there are multiple flavors of USB-C are correct, but this is more of an issue with cable labeling than anything else. That adjustment is better made, than tolerated using half-baked solutions. \nWe've said this before, many times: there is no special hardware required to connect a HDMI or DVI monitor. Given that the Thunderbolt 3 protocol explicitly contains the HDMI protocol, a cable will do, or a dongle if you prefer. There is no breakout box needed for USB-A connectors, and a peripheral cable or dongle there can be had too, depending on what you need.\nFortunately, since you have Thunderbolt 3, and not the other varieties of USB-C, cables are cheap, and plentiful. You can get there from here, and it isn't expensive to do so.16-inch MacBook Pro\nLike we've been saying for nearly four years now, if you're hell-bent on sticking with your existing cabling instead of adopting cables with a USB-C end is choosing from one of many a Thunderbolt dock. Thunderbolt 3 docks start at $199 retail, and USB 3.2 type C ones can be had for cheaper than that, if you don't need the full 40 gigabits per second that the faster protocol allows. \nIn our testing, with a two-hour load on the MacBook Pro using both the CPU and GPU, an 87W Thunderbolt 3 dock or power adapter still drained the battery to the tune of about 4% per hour. Under \"normal\" office use or similar work there was no drain at all. \nIf you have an older Thunderbolt dock from your 2012 or later Retina MacBook Pro, the $49 Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter will connect that unit to the new machine. It won't supply power, but, fortunately, the 96W adapter that your machine came with will.\nFurthermore, if you're considering an external GPU, many of the enclosures have USB-A and Ethernet ports, in an accessory that costs not much more than a dock does. If all you need are a few USB-A ports, get a USB 3.0 dock, along with a USB-C to USB-B cable for around $8. Problem solved. Nothing that we've seen presently for eGPU enclosures provides 96W, but that will likely be rectified very soon.\nRegarding MagSafe, we've been testing USB-C for a very, very long time at this point, and our results are unchanged. On a melamine, Corian, or finished wood desk surface, the force required to pull out Apple's USB-C charging cable is about three-quarters of what it takes to break a MagSafe 2 connection, when the cable is pulled from less than a 40-degree angle from center on the horizontal plane, and less than 30 degrees from center on the vertical. The 96W USB-C power adapter\nAnd, the AC adapter also has a USB-C connector with the same disconnect force, so now there are two rapid breakpoints in the case of an accident or inadvertent pull. \nApple's service numbers that we've collated bear out that the removal of official MagSafe hasn't caused any notable increase in incidents. MagSafe's introduction in January 2006 halved accidental damage service calls by 2009. There was no change in those numbers for MagSafe 2. But, in the three years since the MacBook Pro was released, there has been no increase in the accidental damage rate from a reported cable snag at all.\nWith a 11-hour battery, we're not sure why you'd want to string a power cord along a transit route anyway. If you're that concerned about it, buy a USB-PD battery and keep it next to your computer.\nIf you're still not happy that MagSafe is gone, there are inexpensive options on Amazon.The MacBook Pro is a workhorse, but is not a desktop\nThe MacBook Pro is not going to be the same maximum speed as the Mac Pro. It isn't even going to top the iMac Pro in every regard. But, it is portable, and it is very, very fast. \nIf you're doing long runs of rendering or the like, the iMac Pro will work better for you. Despite some social media posts to the contrary, the iMac Pro is in no way a portable machine. While the new Mac Pro doesn't have those seemingly sharpened handles that the old-school Mac Pro did, it isn't really portable either, even if you spring for the wheels.\nAs the last two i9 MacBook Pro were, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a solid machine, one that is faster than literally every other MacBook Pro ever made, if not by a lot.\nNo matter how much of a Pro you are, not everything is a long processing job, constantly slamming the processor. Even most editing tasks aren't constantly pushing your CPU and GPU to the absolute limits. As we've said time and time again, considering your own workflow in regards to what you do most of the time is crucial in making this decision.Editing in the Final Cut Pro X on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\nIf you're coming from a 2018 or earlier MacBook Pro, including the i9 2018 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with either flavor of i9 processor is unquestionably a great choice. However, the real-world performance for nearly every task that you will do, minus those blue-moon processor-crushing ones, the i9 performance isn't supremely higher than that of the i7 \"baseline\" model.\nAs with every other i9 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a lot of computer, with a lot of power, for a lot of money. There are cheaper machines with the i9, dealing with many of the same thermal constraints, running Windows. \nHow much is macOS worth to you? You can say all you want that there are cheaper Windows options, and you'll be right. But, none of them bring macOS to the table. \nAs it was before, and as it remains, a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an i9 processor is the right tool for macOS jobs that demand portability. It is not the ultimate solution to every macOS-centric computing problem, and those people that need that solution probably already know that they need to wait for the Mac Pro tower.Score 4.5 out of 5Save hundreds on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\nApple resellers are accepting orders for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro with a variety of incentives. Expercom is knocking up to $438 off select new configurations with coupon code appleinsider, while Adorama is taking up to $250 off retail models with promo code APINSIDER (prices start at just $2,199 with code). Details can be found in this 16-inch MacBook Pro deal roundup.\nMeanwhile, at B&H, shoppers can save $100 on the retail systems and select between no interest financing when paid in full within 12 months with the B&H Financing Card or a sales tax refund in eligible states with its Payboo Credit Card. The latter can save many shoppers anywhere from $200 to $500 on average.\nAmazon is also offering instant discounts on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, matching B&H with prices as low as $2,299.\nBe sure to check out the AppleInsider 16-inch MacBook Pro Price Guide for the latest deals and product availability on Apple's new hardware.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n"

Is the service the first step towards the future of gaming, or will Stadia fall flat on its face? Here's what the early reviews say:\n\n\n\nWhat Does Stadia Offer?\n\n\n\nStadia is Google's attempt to make cloud gaming happen, and the company has promised a lot: the ability to play basically any game at up to 4K on your TV, phone, tablet or laptop, with no lag and on existing internet infrastructure. And, based on these broad qualifiers, Stadia delivers.\n\n\n\n[Engadget]\n\n\n\nStadia isn't a console. It's a platform for streaming games from the cloud. You can play Stadia titles on a TV, on a computer or on a smartphone, although there are limitations on all of these categories, as I'll discuss later. You buy whichever game you want to play from Google, then stream it right away. There's no initial download, no patching and no buffering — just instantaneous gameplay.\n\n\n\n[Tom's Guide]\n\n\n\nStadia Is Essentially A Beta Version Until 2020, But The Price Tag Isn't Cheap\n\n\n\nCome November 19, those who anted up $129 for the Google Stadia Founder's Edition or functionally identical Premiere Edition will receive a Stadia controller, a 4K-ready Chromecast Ultra, and three months of the $10-a-month Stadia Pro subscription. This is the only way to get access to Stadia right now and for the foreseeable future.And there's a reason for that: It's the only use case that feels finished. Google Stadia arrives with a litany of missing features, especially on PC and phones. As such, the Chromecast is the only device that supports 4K streaming at release, as well as 5.1 surround sound and the wireless Stadia controller. Those features won't hit other platforms until 2020.\n\n\n\n[PC World]\n\n\n\nStadia's launch day is Tuesday… sort of. Really, consider this the start of Stadia's early-access beta period. Because Google's big promises haven't arrived, and at the price of the Stadia's Founder's Edition, I can't recommend anyone jump onboard at the moment. Google's experimental game streaming service, Stadia, launches without many of its promised features, and just a handful of games. It works, but there's not much incentive to buy in.\n\n\n\n[CNET]\n\n\n\nDespite The Monthly Fee, You're Still Buying — Not Renting — Games\n\n\n\nWhile you've probably heard predictions that Google's Stadia will be the \"Netflix of games,\" it turns out the analogy only goes so far. While Google intends to eventually have a back catalog of free games included for your $10 monthly fee, Stadia is not primarily a subscription service. The subscription only includes a single game as of today — Destiny 2. Primarily, Google tells us you should expect to buy, not rent cloud games for the same retail prices you'd find on other platforms like PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Steam.\n\n\n\n[The Verge]\n\n\n\nEven when Stadia is at its best though, there's a catch: You will never own your Stadia games. You will never have local copies on your hardware, which means you have access to your games (games you paid for) only as long as they stay in the Stadia library. If Google decides to remove certain titles, or shutter the service entirely (it happens, pretty often in fact), the games you paid for will be gone.\n\n\n\n[Wired]\n\n\n\nStadia's Current Roster Of Games Isn't Very Impressive\n\n\n\nStadia's 22 launch titles are uninspiring. They include: Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2, Destiny 2: The Collection, Farming Simulator 2019, Final Fantasy XV, Football Manager 2020, Grid 2019, Gylt, Just Dance 2020, Kine, Metro Exodus, Mortal Kombat 11, NBA 2K20, Rage 2, Red Dead Redemption 2, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Samurai Shodown, Thumper, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 2013, Trials Rising, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. About half came out this year, one is a Stadia exclusive (Gylt), and almost all of them are available on other platforms.\n\n\n\n[Inverse]\n\n\n\nProvided You Have A Solid Internet Connection, The Streaming Quality Seems To Be Mostly Excellent\n\n\n\nStadia's performance is promising at worst, and impressive at best. Sitting in my bedroom, controller in hand, streaming Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4K resolution, HDR color and 5.1 surround sound without a console anywhere in sight, I couldn't help but feel a little astounded. If this is the future of gaming, I could get used to it, at least on some level.\n\n\n\n[Tom's Guide]\n\n\n\nThe bulk of my time on the Stadia was spent with the system in traditional TV mode. That means the Stadia controller connecting to Google's servers over wifi, and a Chromecast Ultra plugged into the back of my TV doing the same. For \"best performance\", Google recommends wiring the Chromecast up to a LAN, but doing so felt like overkill. Only once did I experience anything that looked like lag (when sending a picture message to my partner); every other time, it was perfect.\n\n\n\n[The Guardian]\n\n\n\nI have very fast internet connection at home, so the games were really crisp and fluid most of the time. It felt, generally, like I was playing on a regular console. But every now and again, I'd be reminded I was streaming when the graphics in a game dropped to a lower quality, or if the game just unexpectedly quit. That doesn't happen often on an Xbox or a PS4, and it's bad news if you're trying to finish a level or fight someone in a multiplayer game.\n\n\n\n[CNBC]\n\n\n\nThe Stadia Controller Is Only Necessary For Playing On A TV, But It's Very Comfortable\n\n\n\nGoogle's gone way over the top comparing the controller to a chef's knife, but it's an excellent controller, seriously. It feels something like a blend of the XBox One controller and Nintendo Switch pro controller, with smooth analog triggers, solid rumble haptics, crisp analog sticks and d-pad. Playing with it feels effortless. I like how the Stadia button turns the platform on, and a solid rumble-throb kicks in to let you know the service has connected.\n\n\n\n[CNET]\n\n\n\nThe controller is really comfortable to hold over long periods of time and has good battery life. That's important, since it's the only way to control the games you're playing. The button layout is different, but it was just as comfortable and really similar to the Nintendo Switch Pro controller. Setup between devices was usually pretty easy. I just turned the controller on and plugged it into either the Pixel 3a or computer I was using. Google says the controller will eventually work wirelessly with phones as it does with the Chromecast Ultra.\n\n\n\n[CNBC]\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n\n\nThere's no reason anyone should buy into Stadia right now. Google has made sure of that, partly by underdelivering at launch and partly with a pricing scheme that sees you paying three times (for hardware, for the service, for games) just to be an early adopter.\n\n\n\n[The Verge]\n\n\n\nIs Google Stadia the future? That's really two questions, I guess. First, \"Is streaming the future of gaming?\" Possibly. It's convenient, and even exciting at times. But if you're asking whether Stadia is the platform to get us there? I have my doubts.\n\n\n\n[PC World]\n\n\n\nGame streaming is finally viable, and Stadia is leading the charge — but with this launch, it's turning out to be more of a stroll. Hey, at least we're getting there.\n\n\n\n[Engadget]\n\n\n\nIf you're on the fence about investing $129 in an unproven service, you're not alone.

Retherford/SWRI)\n\n\nThe Jupiter moon Europa's elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed seem to be real.NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such plumes emanating from Europa, which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath its ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume's water vapor directly for the first time, a new study reports.\"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are found all over the solar system. But the third â€” liquid water â€” is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and American University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.Related: Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in ImagesPaganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study the 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as one of the solar system's best bets to host alien life.Â The researchers observed Europa for 17 nights, from February 2016 through May 2017. On one of those nights â€”Â April 26, 2016 â€” they got a strong signal of water vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared light.Â And there was quite a bit of the stuff â€”Â about 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons), according to the researchers' calculations. That's almost enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric tons, of water).The researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be coming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa's shell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted to result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules from Europa's surface by Jupiter's powerful radiation belts. And such stripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be noted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in the new paper, which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature Astronomy.Multiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For example, in addition to the new results and Hubble's detection of atomic hydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by radiation), NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe measured a big increase in the density of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.And it's becoming increasingly clear that Europa's plumes are sporadic. In that regard, they're very different from the constant plume wafting from the south pole of Saturn's icy, ocean-harboring moon Enceladus, which is generated by more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct detection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits of our detection method,\" Paganini said.Plumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to astrobiologists, because they're sending \"free samples\" from potentially habitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic probes. And there's a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just that, if everything works out just right.NASA is developing a mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close on dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for spots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future. Clipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys, if mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years â€”Â  or if they just get really lucky.Â NASA Europa Mission Could Potentially Spot Signs of Alien LifePhotos: Europa, Mysterious Icy Moon of JupiterKeck Observatory: Twin Telescopes on Mauna KeaMike Wall's book about the search for alien life, \"Out There\" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), is out now.

As a defense, the Browns had 11 hits on Mason Rudolph (well, 12 if you count the helmet hit). 8 of those hits came from the defensive line. 5 of those hits were from two players facing suspension now (2 for Larry Ogunjobi, 3 for Myles Garrett).\n\nOgunjobi and Garrett have been playing a ton of snaps all season. Since Olivier Vernonâ€™s injury a couple of weeks ago, Chad Thomas has filled in and played way above my expectations (including logging another sack this week and almost having an interception). The problem is that Cleveland really doesnâ€™t have a long-term option to replace those snaps in the starting lineup.\nIdeally, Vernon would come back from his knee injury this week, but when heâ€™ll return is still a question mark. Is veteran Chris Smith going to get most of Garrettâ€™s snaps (actually, Thomas would shift over)? Smith is good for depth, but as a starter, thatâ€™s a hefty downgrade. The same goes for Ogunjobi up front. Sheldon Richardson is the only starter in tact right now; Iâ€™d expect some works for this weekâ€™s game in Miami.\n\n\n  \n    Linebacker\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Pos\n        \n          Player\n        \n          Plays\n        \n          %\n        \n          Stats\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Pos\n        \n          Player\n        \n          Plays\n        \n          %\n        \n          Stats\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            LB\n          \n            Joe Schobert\n          \n            74\n          \n            100%\n          \n            7 tackles, 3 assists (10 combined). 1 sack, 2 TFL, 2 QH, 2 INT, 4 passes defended.\n          \n        \n      \n        \n          \n            LB\n          \n            Mack Wilson\n          \n            74\n          \n            100%\n          \n            1 tackle, 4 assists (5 combined). 1 pass defended.\n          \n        \n      \n        \n          \n            LB\n          \n            Sione Takitaki\n          \n            6\n          \n            8%\n          \n            No stats registered.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n\nThis was an amazing game for Joe Schobert, who filled up the stat sheet in impressive fashion.

The Steelers had no offensive players (with experience) left, so they wisely took the approach of chucking the ball down the sideline and hoping for a catch or interference. Williams was flagged once for it, but was borderline on a few other plays, and against better receivers, would have allowed the big catches. He needs to get his head snapped around more on those plays to locate the ball. On the bright side, his run defense has been great.\n\n\n#Browns Greedy Williams has been solid in run support and tackling so far this season.

Safety depth has been shaky all season due to injury, and whatever that Jermaine Whitehead experiment was.\n\nJuston Burris and Sheldrick Redwine both stepped up to the plate and did a good job. But that was against Mason Rudolph, a below average quarterback. Fortunately, Randall will be back, and Burnett was never viewed as a long-term answer at strong safety. I donâ€™t know what direction Steve Wilks will go at strong safety, but I like the way Burris has played when given opportunities. When Eric Murray returns from injury, itâ€™ll probably be his starting job the rest of the way.\n\n\n"

        "articleBody": "The presidentâ€™s unpredictability and demands of China are complicating an end to the long-running dispute, experts say.Credit...Anna Moneymaker/The New York TimesWhen President Trumpâ€™s advisers suggested that Beijing resume buying around $20 billion in American farm products as part of a trade deal, Mr. Trump wasnâ€™t satisfied. In a dramatic public retelling in the Cabinet Room, he said he pressed his team to more than triple that figure, then trimmed that a little and asked for up to $50 billion in annual purchases. â€œMy people had $20 billion done,â€� Mr. Trump recounted in an Oct. 21 cabinet meeting. â€œAnd I said, â€˜I want more.â€™ They said, â€˜The farmers canâ€™t handle it.â€™ I said, â€˜Tell them to buy larger tractors. Itâ€™s very simple.â€™â€� The cabinet members gathered around Mr. Trump laughed. Mr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade talks with China, injecting public drama into typically staid proceedings. He has alternated displays of anger and warmth toward Beijing and assumed the role of the insatiable negotiator, pairing ambitious goals for a trade pact with even bigger threats should China not accede to his terms. But more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern history, Mr. Trumpâ€™s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he hoped for. Instead, the presidentâ€™s cliffhanger tactics appear to have made it even harder to bring complex trade talks to a close and exacerbated economic uncertainty across the globe. Despite Mr. Trumpâ€™s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and China had reached a â€œhistoricâ€� Phase 1 trade agreement, actually signing a deal has proved elusive. The two sides continue to negotiate and could finalize an agreement in the next few weeks, if negotiators decide to compromise. But Mr. Trump continues to give mixed signals about whether he actually wants a deal and if any of his tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be removed.â€œWeâ€™re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,â€� Mr. Trump said on Nov. 8. â€œI like our situation very much. They want to make a deal much more than I do, but we could have a deal.â€�A prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It allows him to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid Democratic criticism that he is caving to Beijing.But businesses are not entertained. The unrelenting trade fight has prolonged financial pain for American farmers, companies and consumers, paralyzing firms that rely on robust trade flows between the worldâ€™s two largest economies.Executives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone some hiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not crippled by unforeseen policies, and conserve cash. The uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly manufacturing, which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, while Germany has barely avoided falling into recession. â€œItâ€™s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions are threatening to put the brakes on growth,â€� John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. â€œThe uncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on the economic conditions weâ€™re experiencing today.â€�Mr. Trumpâ€™s theatrical embrace is not limited to China. He has injected similar drama into trade talks with other partners, including Europe, Japan, Canada and Mexico, publicly threatening them with tariffs and suggesting he might leave some trading partners behind.The president says his approach has created leverage â€” and in some cases, he is right. The threat of tariffs has prompted officials from Mexico, Canada, Japan and elsewhere to make concessions they might not otherwise have agreed to. It has also brought China, which is heavily reliant on exports to the United States, to the negotiating table. But that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks to a close. Mr. Trumpâ€™s tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China wary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more, people familiar with Chinese trade policy said.Eswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the presidentâ€™s â€œmercurial temperament and predilection to undercutting his own negotiating teamâ€� had complicated the already challenging task of striking a deal. â€œBy hyping up expectations and setting unrealistic goals for the trade talks, Trump makes the prospects for any sort of trade deal with China more uncertain and volatile,â€� he said.The two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of domestic protests. Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take place in United States â€œfarm country,â€� but the Chinese have been reluctant to commit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized. Without a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure to get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the presidentâ€™s unpredictable behavior â€” as demonstrated by his abrupt departure from a high-profile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Koreaâ€™s leader, Kim Jong-un. They fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they anticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi, according to people familiar with their thinking. Mr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the only president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and that the United States will be better off. Many businesses agree that China has long taken advantage of the United States and support Mr. Trumpâ€™s efforts to remove trade barriers and end coercive practices that have disadvantaged American firms operating in China.But they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated tensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack of resolution has been discouraging, given that many analysts believe that the administration is tackling only the easiest issues in its Phase 1 deal, and leaving more contentious topics, like the subsidies that China gives to its industry, for later talks. The roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on certainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of products that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China trade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the Trump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of goods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect â€” or whether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would remain.â€œIt makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,â€� said Phil Levy, the chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates international shipments for companies. â€œIt really doesnâ€™t fit well with the world of global supply chains. And weâ€™re talking to a lot of businesses who are having difficulty with that.â€�Even Mr. Trumpâ€™s supporters have trouble at times disguising their frustration with his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging feeling that the president doesnâ€™t want the show to end.In a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau, said farmers faced â€œnear-unprecedented economic uncertainty and hardshipâ€� stemming from the escalation of tariffs in China and other key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon as possible, saying â€œtime is running out for many in agriculture.â€�But Mr. Trumpâ€™s approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal, including securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month. American negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the massive purchases Mr. Trump requested â€” larger purchases â€œthan any time in our history, by farâ€� â€” into the actual text of a trade agreement. While China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork, it has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it favors American products over other countriesâ€™, as well as agreements that could result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through. Even if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy and genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the calculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could increase its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a year, without diverting trade from elsewhere. Mr. Trumpâ€™s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his administration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies will be removed if a deal is reached. The president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval Office with Liu He, Chinaâ€™s top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump canceled an increase in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention of rolling back any levies. That has not gone over well with the Chinese, who have since been under pressure domestically for seemingly giving away too much to the United States.â€œWithout rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not raising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive of implementing this deal on the Chinese part?â€� He Jianxiong, the former executive director for China at the International Monetary Fund, said at a Nov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in Washington.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\n"

        "articleBody": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSebelum Islam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah zaman Khalifah Ali karena pemberontakan Muâ€™awiyah di tahun 37 Hijriyah. 26 tahun setelah wafatnya Nabi. Islam sudah sempurna secara aqidah mau pun fiqih. Islam sudah sempurna sebelum Nabi Muhammad SAW wafat. Jadi baik Sunni dan Syiah yg sebagian besar sahabat Nabi itu aqidah dan ibadahnya sama: Islam.\nZaman Sahabat itu zaman terbaik Islam. Karena Islam saat itu sudah sempurna dan amat murni. Masih banyak orang2 yg melihat langsung amal ibadah Nabi, ngobrol bersama Nabi, berjuang bersama Nabi. Sementara kita di akhir zaman ini belum tentu benar karena sudah diselubungi fitnah.\nIslam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiâ€™ah karena faktor politik. Karena kekuasaan. Pendukung Ali disebut Syiah Ali yg kemudian disebut Syiah saja. Pendukung Muawiyah dan yg netral disebut Sunni.\nSetelah pecah itulah jalan sendiri2.\nImam Jaâ€™far Ash Shadiq yg merupakan guru dari Imam Malik dan Imam Abu HaÃ±ifah membentuk Mazhab Jaâ€™fari. Imam Malik yg merupakan guru dari Imam Syafiâ€™ie membentuk mazhab Maliki. Imam Abu Hanifah membentuk mazhab Hanafi. Imam Syafiâ€™ie guru dari Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Syafiâ€™ie. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Hanbali. Mereka semua punya hubungan guru dan murid.\nDari sini juga perawi hadits Sunni dan Syiah jalan sendiri2. Imam Kulayni bikin kitab hadits Al Kafi. Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim dsb bikin kitab Shahih Bukhari, Shahih Muslim dsb. Sebagian perawi haditsnya dari Syiah bahkan di Rijalul Hadits ada yg disebut Rafidhi karena tak membolehkan orang bernama Muâ€™awiyah masuk ke rumahnya.\nAda juga percampuran Ilmu misalnya orang Syiah belajar dari ulama Sunni dan orang Sunni belajar dari ulama Syiah. Contoh kitab Subulus Salam yg biasa diajarkan di pesantren2 NU ternyata disusun oleh ulama Syiah.\nCuma sekali lagi zaman Nabi Islam sudah sempurna. Jadi saat para sahabat pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah, Islam mereka sudah sempurna meski saat itu mazhab fiqih dan kitab2 hadits belum ditulis.\nJadi keliru karena Syiah beda dgn Sunni langsung dibilang bukan Islam. Pelajari dulu sejarah Islam dari berbagai sumber. Bukan dgn 1 mata.â� â� \nPenghinaan terhadap Istri dan Sahabat Nabi\nSebelumnya kita tegaskan bahwa menghina istri Nabi Siti â€˜Aisyah ra dan menghina Khulafaur Rosyidiin seperti Abu Bakar ra, Umar bin Khoththob ra, Usman bin Affan ra, dan Ali bin Abi Talib ra adalah perbuatan yang sesat. Harusnya dapat sanksi hukum misalnya 10 tahun penjara atau lebih berat lagi.\nSyiâ€™ah Rafidhoh yang gemar menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi seperti Yasir Habib dan Tawhidi ternyata dipelihara Zionis Yahudi untuk memecah-belah Islam. Video Yasir Habib saat syahadah sering disebar ole Wahabi. Untuk menimbulkan kemarahan dan perang sesama Islam tentunya. Yasir Habib ternyata dipelihara London dan diberi dana untuk bikin Fadak TV. Tawhidi yang sekarang diundang ke Indonesia oleh Emilia Renita dari Oase dipelihara oleh Australia. Gunanya untuk membuat Indonesia kacau.\nBukan cuma istri dan sahabat Nabi yang dihina oleh Rafidhi macam Yasir Habib. Bahkan Imam tertinggi Syiâ€™ah pun seperti Ali Khamenei mereka hina karena mengharamkan penghinaan tsb.\nAhmadinejad: Siapa Menghina Sahabat Rasulullah Sekutu Musuh Islam\nPresiden Ahmadinejad menandaskan, â€œDari tribun ini saya tegaskan bahwa barang siapa di mana pun ia berada menghina sahabat Rasulullah saw, maka ia bukanlah seorang muslim dan tidak bergerak di atas jalan Islam. Ia tidak lebih hanyalah kaki tangan dan alat mainan musuh-musuh asing.â€�\nhttp://www.ipabionline.com/2013/02/ahmadinejad-siapa-menghina-sahabat.html#ixzz2PpyAj3AN\nKhamenei: Haram Menghina Istri Nabi dan SimbolÂ Ahlusunah\nhttp://syiahali.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/fatwa-para-ulama-larangan-mencaci-para-sahabat/\nFatwa Para Ulama Syiâ€™ah Larangan Mencaci Para Sahabat\nhttp://www.shia-explained.com/my/archives/2364\nSekarang kita lihat asal muasal penghinaan terhadap istri dan sahabat Nabi.\nSaya dulu merasa kehidupan semua sahabat rukun dan damai. Itu benar di zaman Nabi. Saat Nabi wafat, timbul perdebatan siapa yang berhak menjadi pemimpin ummat Islam sebagai Nabi. Kaum Syiâ€™ah umumnya berpendapat Ali berhak menjadi Khalifah. Sementara mayoritas sahabat mengangkat Abu Bakar ra sebagai Khalifah. Suka tidak suka, semua sahabat membaiâ€™at Abu Bakar sebagai Khalifah. Termasuk Ali.\nSaat Ali jadi khalifah, Siti â€˜Aisyah memberontak dalam perang yang disebut Perang Jamal yang menewaskan 17.000 orang. Saat Muâ€™awiyah berontak dalam perang Siffin pun ada 70.000 Muslim yang tewas. Dari pihak Ali 25.000 orang yang tewas. Dari pihak Muâ€™awiyah, 45.000 orang yang tewas.\nNah kalau para sahabat ini saling bunuh dalam Perang Jamal dan Perang Siffin, tentu diawali dengan perang lisan dan juga tulisan. Saling hina. Bisa jadi tulisan2 yang mengina sampai ke kita hingga sekarang. Ini mirip saat Pilpres 2014 antara Jokowi melawan Prabowo di mana masing2 pengikut menghina yang lain. Bahkan Jokowi difitnah sebagai kafir sehingga keluarlah foto2 Jokowi sedang sholat.\nItulah asal muasal penghinaan istri dan sahabat Nabi. Itu satu lembaran hitam sejarah yang harusnya kita tutup. Menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi yg dilakukan sebagian kaum Syiâ€™ah dan menghina orang tua Nabi yg dilakukan Wahabi itu dosa besar. Cuma kalau taubat dan pemimpinnya mengharamkannya, ya selesai. Allah Maha Pengampun.\nManusia itu sifatnya salah dan lupa. Sebaik2 orang salah adalah orang yang taubat. Nabi Adam dan Nabi Yunus pun pernah salah, tapi begitu tobat, diampuni oleh Allah. Begitu. Makanya KH Quraish Shihab saat menilai Syiâ€™ah itu sesat atau lurus, beliau juga melihat perkembangan mereka. Yang tobat dan mengharamkan penghinaan thd sahabat ya otomatis tidak sesat. Sebaliknya yang tetap menghina, ini sesat.\nPenghinaan pun macam-macam tingkatnya. Dari sekedar kritik yang santun, hingga penghinaan yang amat amat keji. Kitabnya pun ada. Sahabat yang dihina pun macam-macam. Dari sahabat Abu Bakar ra dan Umar bin Khoththob yang namanya dijamin Nabi masuk surga, hingga Muâ€™awiyah yang masuk Islam setelah Futuh Mekkah da anaknya Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, Sayyidina Husein ra.\nMenghina Siti Aisyah ra, Abu Bakar ra, dan Umar bin Khoththob ra tidak dibenarkan apa pun alasannya. Sesat. Sebaliknya menyatakan bahwa Muâ€™awiyah berontak terhadap Khalifah Ali atau Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, itu sekedar kritik berdasarkan fakta sejarah. Namun kaum Sunni tetap menjaga lisan mereka untuk tidak mengutuk atau menghina Muâ€™awiyah dan Yazid. Urusan mereka ada di tangan Allah.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFiled under: Syi'ah |\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n"

        "articleBody": "\n  After a three-year silence, there has been news on the fourth film in rebooted Star Trek film series: Noah Hawley, best known for creating FXâ€™s Legion and Fargo TV series, is in final talks to write and direct it, according to reports from The Wrap and Deadline. \nThe most recent Star Trek film was 2016â€™s Star Trek Beyond. Unlike the original two films in the modern iteration of the franchise, Star Trek Beyond was directed by Justin Lin; 2009â€™s Star Trek and 2013â€™s Star Trek Into Darkness were directed by J.J. Abrams. Abrams was a producer on Star Trek Beyond, and will be reprising the role in the as-yet-untitled fourth film. \n\nThe fourth Star Trek film was greenlit in 2016, with reports that Chris Hemsworth would be returning to the franchise to reprise his role as George Kirk, the father of Chris Pineâ€™s Captain James T. Kirk. Obviously, three years is a long time, and actorsâ€™ schedules shift. Itâ€™s unclear whether Hawleyâ€™s film is still based on the 2016 plan, or if Hemsworth will return â€” both Hemsworth and Pine were said to have had run into contractual issues in 2018, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Wrapâ€™s report today claims that Pine will be back on board the Enterprise, along with Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban. It doesnâ€™t mention Hemsworth.\nThere are three scripts still in contention for the fourth Trek film, according to The Wrap, so itâ€™s possible Paramount is still deciding on a direction. As if things werenâ€™t murky enough, Deadline reports that Paramount is also still working on a second, R-rated Star Trek spin-off from Quentin Tarantino, which has been rumored since 2017. \nThe fourth Star Trek movie will be Hawleyâ€™s second film. Lucy in the Sky, his debut, is a slightly more grounded story about a NASA astronaut dealing with life on Earth. That movie was poorly-recieved by critics â€” and flopped at the box office, making $320,000 on a budget of $27 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\nNo release date for the fourth Star Trek film has yet been announced. \n\n"

He said he wasn't concerned about the content of the call, but he did worry there would be \"political consequences\" if more people had access to the call summary.Republicans also questioned Morrison about his closed-door testimony, in which he raised questions about the judgment of another witness, Alexander Vindman, who is the White House National Security Council Ukraine expert. After Fiona Hill left the NSC, it was Morrison who took over, and Vindman reported to him.\nHere are some of the highlights:\"My fears have been realized\"\n\n          Day 3, Part 10: Tim Morrison's opening statement\n\n                  \n        \n        \n              Morrison told the Intelligence Committee, \"I feared at the time of the call on July 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate. My fears have been realized.\" He begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the illegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day that the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings instead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\" mutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.2. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\n\n          Volker: Allegations against Biden are \"not credible\"\n\n                  \n        \n        \n              \"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening statement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September 25, 2019.\"Volker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation into Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate Ukrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he heard the July 25 call.\"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not credible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into Burisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how Ukrainian officials could be confused.3. \"Not some irregular channel\"\n\n          Volker insists he worked through \"official\" Ukraine channel, \"cringes\" at \"three amigos\" references\n\n                  \n        \n        \n              Volker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what's been portrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\nHe denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were known as the \"Three Amigos.\" Volker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe when I hear it.\"4. Questioning Vindman's judgment\n\n          Morrison discusses concerns about Vindman's judgment\n\n                  \n        \n        \n              Republican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC about Alexander Vindman's judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his predecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison's lawyer said the question was outside the scope of his testimony.Morrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had raised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect Vindman denied earlier in the day.Morrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about concerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal counsel.\"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that's something I would've expected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman's superior, said. In his testimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National Security Adviser John Bolton — Morrison's supervisor — to go straight to the NSC legal counsel with his concerns.Morrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion from some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\n5. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging\n\n          Volker says there was nothing unusual about hold on aid\n\n                  \n        \n        \n              \"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it on July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever knew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the delay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"Volker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of August, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold released, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was an internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said. \"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that same time.\" 6. \"The Gordon problem\"\n\n          Tim Morrison on \"the Gordon problem\"\n\n                  \n        \n        \n              Morrison testified that he didn't always follow through on suggestions from Sondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland's role in forming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"7. \"The Giuliani problem\"Volker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the new Ukrainian president was not corrupt. However, he said the July 25 call made him realize Giuliani and the president still believed Ukraine needed to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.\"So it's fair to say you have not fixed the 'Giuliani problem'?\" Schiff asked.\"That's correct,\" Volker said. \n\n  \n"

        "articleBody": "A UK man’s innocent decision to change his bedding caused him to develop a strange, rare condition that left him gasping for air, his doctors say. In a new case study out Monday, they detail how the man came down with a rare form of allergy to the bird feathers that filled his new duvet and pillows.According to the study, published in BMJ Case Reports, the 43-year-old man had suffered months of dizziness, fatigue, and breathlessness by the time he visited his local doctor in November 2016.At first, his doctor assumed he had a lower respiratory tract infection, like bronchitis, and his symptoms did improve soon after. But by December, they worsened, to the point where he could no longer walk to the next room in his house without feeling out of breath. His doctor referred him to an urgent respiratory care clinic and sought out advice from one of the study authors, Owen Dempsey, a chest doctor at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.Dempsey talked with the man over the phone, trying to zero in any potential causes for his symptoms. And once the man mentioned that he and his wife had recently switched from synthetic bedding to a feather duvet and feather pillows, Dempsey quickly came up with a preliminary diagnosis that was later confirmed by lab testing: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or HP.The man had a particular form of HP that tends to strike people who raise or work closely with birds, which has earned it the nickname of “bird fancier’s lung.” But in cases where people have gotten HP simply from being exposed to feather bedding, it’s instead been dubbed “feather duvet lung.”“In some individuals that meet proteins from bird droppings or dust from their feathers, their immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion—think Donald Trump rather than Barack Obama,” Dempsey told Gizmodo by email.HP, as Gizmodo very recently explained, is a complex and rare condition. It involves different antibodies than the ones that cause a typical food or skin allergy. That means it isn’t detectable through a standard allergy test, nor do people  react instantaneously when they’re exposed to their trigger. It’s also not clear why any one person develops HP, since many of us can carry these specific antibodies to a trigger but never become sick.“Most people of course don’t get this, and it depends on how their immune system is primed and is affected by their genetics,” Dempsey said.Because Dempsey quickly suspected feather duvet lung, though, he told the man to remove the bedding from his home the very first time they spoke. And within days, he began to improve. Subsequent treatment with steroids seemed to speed up his recovery, though Dempsey noted there’s no definitive evidence that steroids will help with HP. Regardless, by the time he was weaned off treatment a year later, he was back to normal.“It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,” the man wrote in a patient perspective accompanying the case report.While it’s likely that more people contract feather duvet lung than is documented, given how hard it is to diagnose, it’s not something you should be worried about if you’ve been sleeping contently under a down-filled duvet with no issues.“Hold onto your feather bedding, but if you do get chest symptoms, e.g. breathlessness or cough, mention it to your health care professional,” Dempsey said. “Most don’t think about it.”\n"

She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to leave for other jobs.\n        \n    \n        \n            “We need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,” Cooper said. “They start in the classroom but then they leave because they aren’t paid enough.”\n        \n    \n        \n            Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand teachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct money from the state’s $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools.\n        \n    \n        \n            “The crisis is now, and we need action now,” Gambill said to cheers from the crowd. “The issue is funding, and the state has the money.”\n        \n    \n        \n            Nearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers unions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of their 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than 15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least 5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency didn’t estimate how many total were on the grounds.\n        \n    \n        \n            Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have avoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings. They seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers who used sick days to rally. However, they said they don’t expect to take action on further boosting school funding until at least 2021.\n        \n    \n        \n            Other teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona.\n        \n    \n        \n            While some Indiana protesters chanted, “Red for Ed,” in a Statehouse hallway, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state budget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by 2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted the plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay.\n        \n    \n        \n            Bosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state’s new ILEARN standardized exam taken last spring – one of the top concerns of the teachers unions.\n        \n    \n        \n            “We get that you’re frustrated,” Bosma said. “We get that you are concerned about issues.”\n        \n    \n        \n            Teachers didn’t see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he was keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of the Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward Holcomb’s 2016 election campaign.\n        \n    \n        \n            The governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in February to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020.\n        \n    \n        \n            Education advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was needed to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states. Republican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study showing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since 2002.\n        \n    \n        \n            McCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the state’s private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they weren’t “asking for the moon.”\n        \n    \n        \n            “What a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,” she said.\n        \n    \n        \n            Joel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana’s Richmond High School, said politicians have “vilified” educators.\n        \n    \n        \n            “They think they know better about education than us,” he said. “They don’t trust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when we’re in the classroom.”\n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n            \n        \n"

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\"You’re going to see a number of things that Stadia can do that is not possible on other platforms,\" says Jack Buser, director for games at the tech giant.\n\nGoogle's long-gestating foray into gaming has finally arrived as the tech giant's game streaming service, Stadia, launched Tuesday morning. \n\"Stadia has been built from the ground up to be a cloud platform,\" Jack Buser, director for games at Google, tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"You’re going to see a number of things that Stadia can do that is not possible on other platforms.\"\nGoogle's gaming offering, which is offered at a $9.99 monthly rate for its Stadia Pro subscription (there is also a $129.99 Premiere Edition available for preorder that includes a controller, Chromecast Ultra and three months of Stadia Pro and a free tier of the Stadia service is due out next year), is centered on the growing industry of game streaming, allowing players to access AAA titles while on-the-go through their smart phone device, tablet or computer, as well as their TV. The key to Stadia's success, says Buser, is Google's built-in infrastructure. \"We have one of the largest private networks in the world,\" he says, boasting that Google's servers can \"deliver extremely high fidelity content all over the world.\" The goal is to deliver a \"seamless experience\" that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device they choose to play on. \nStadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was announced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed last week), featuring popular franchises such as Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny and more. Notably, only one title at launch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works' Gylt, while most of the other games offered have been on the market for months on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia throughout the end of the year and into 2020.\nLewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm IDC, sees Stadia's lineup as its \"Achilles heel.\" While the monthly subscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60 frames per second and discounts on certain titles (Destiny 2 is available for free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for Stadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the games having been on the market for some time already.\n\"They need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,\" says Ward. \"Google’s planned 'free' base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the hole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming community...and that should seed interest in the Founder’s Edition bundle and Pro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games catalog will probably stay fairly thin and there’s a lot of other gaming options out there.\"\nFor established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both of which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google's platform), Stadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. \"Google offers an extension of the market of people who can play our games,\" says Chris Early, senior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. \"They help extend our reach by letting people who maybe don’t own a console or PC join in.\"\n\"Our strategy is to be where the consumer is,\" Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, adds. \"Generally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader distribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We’re excited by the opportunity and we’ll see how it goes.\"\nGoogle is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the industry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not the only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony Now service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project xCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with plans for its full launch set for next year. \nFor the nascent game streaming industry, \"2020 will be about getting these services in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,\" Ward says. \"I think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by several of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.\"\n\"Streaming is somewhat binary,\" says Early. \"You are either in a place with adequate bandwidth or you’re not.\" In places like San Francisco and New York, bandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still says Ubisoft are \"believers\" in game streaming as a viable future for the industry.\n\"The groundwork is there,\" Buser says. \"In terms of running games and having an experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist today. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will break the boundaries of what was previously possible. It's just staggering.\"\nWhile Stadia's current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only three games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early says there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and launched specifically for the platform. \"Our objective is to make the best game and get it in front of as many people as possible,\" he says. \"I think the interesting question is if we’re getting to a place that requires a game to be run in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not be that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a cloud base, whether that’s xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become something we'd look at.\"\nWhile aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also stepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade subscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was the list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple's offering, all of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out each week. \n\"I think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches next year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,\" says Ward. \nBuser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the future of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early going. \"This is where you’ll see the next big jump in what games can be,\" he says. \"You’ll never download a game or have to download an update. We’re already used to this in movies and TV, we just haven’t seen it in games yet. It’s tough to go back to console.\"\n\n"

The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said Avi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel.\n\nErekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the Palestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state.\n\n\"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally, externally, regionally - to put pressure on us. We stand tall and we will stand tall.\"\n\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n      Via SyndiGate.infoCopyright @ 2019 The New Arab.\n  \n\n\n  \n      You may also like\n    \n\n      \n            \n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n      You may also like\n    \n\n      \n            \n      \n  \n\n\n     Subscribe \n    \n        Sign up to our newsletter for exclusive updates and enhanced content\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n"

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\tOn Nov. 15, 2019, former U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Shortly after, some of Trump’s defenders took to social media apparently to discredit her testimony, claiming that the ambassador’s net worth far exceeded her salary, insinuating because of some illicit means:\n\nWe have found no evidence to corroborate this claim.\nThose making the claim have offered a wide range of figures. We also found that this claim did not originate with a credible financial news outlet, such as Forbes, and that the websites publishing this information have offered no evidence.  Furthermore, while this claim implies some sort of wrongdoing on her part, no one has offered any information about how she supposedly built her alleged fortune. \nIn other words, this claim appears to have been conjured out of thin air. \nWhile the tweet shown above claimed that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million, other social media users have offered differing estimates of her net worth:\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancies in this claim is that there is no credible evidence for the estimates. \nSome social media users pointed to articles published on Walikali and Gossipgist to support their claim that Yovanovitch’s net worth far exceeded her salary. However, just like the above-displayed tweets, these sites offered no evidence to support their estimates. \nThe articles published on these websites provide some basic biographical information about the former ambassador to Ukraine. They do not, however, provide any insight into any business dealings or investments that Yovanovitch may have made that could have resulted in a $17 million net worth. Instead, they simply tacked on their estimate ($6 million in both cases) without making any attempt to justify that figure. \nWe reached out to Walikali and Gossipgist for more information on how they arrived at their estimates and will update this article if more information becomes available.\nIn sum, the claim that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million (or $12 million or $6 million or $3 million) is wholly unsubstantiated. This rumor appears to have been made up out of whole cloth in an apparent attempt to discredit her U.S. House testimony. \n\n\t\t\n"

        "articleBody": "The merger of the big newspaper chains Gannett and GateHouse Media, which became final Tuesday, will create a “stronger” and “more viable” print and digital news enterprise “with deep local roots and national scale.”That’s the optimistic view mouthed by Michael Reed, the CEO of New Media Investment Group, GateHouse’s parent, on Nov. 14 after the deal was approved by shareholders of both companies. One would hope so, since the news business could use an injection of optimism these days. Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the “new Gannett,” as Reed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news organizations.\n    Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole.\n\n    \n        News industry analyst Ken Doctor\n    \n\nBut there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of local news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and managements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough to take up the slack. \nAdvertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast majority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that digital advertisers don’t much care for.“Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,” says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That’s produced a strategy of “continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in local news.” The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media companies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time. The merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said that he expects to wring as much as $300 million in “synergies” from the combination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the workforce. Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60 employees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it “immaterial”) and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred.\n\nThe private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register, Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and boasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the publicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources — with good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about twice the rate of the industry as a whole. (Alden on Tuesday announced that it had become the largest shareholder of Tribune, the former owner of The Times, by acquiring the entire 25.2% stake held by Tribune’s former chairman, Michael Ferro, for $13 a share or $117.9 million.)But public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can’t escape the industry’s economic challenges. Sacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento Bee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news industry’s coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue of $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss reflected a write-down of the company’s news assets. But the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million. McClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn’t have the cash or cash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its pension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by the government’s Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. McClatchy’s parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly demanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune’s largest shareholder.\nThat said, the two companies might have made a good fit, as Tribune’s large-market publications would have balanced McClatchy’s stable of smaller metro newspapers. \nTribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having paid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500 million. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major shareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.Indeed, Doctor asserts that talks have resumed between McClatchy and Tribune.  Both companies declined to comment on the assertion.The most important question raised by the ostensibly synergistic consolidation in the news industry represented by the acquisition spree of firms such as Alden and the Gannett-Gatehouse merger is what the owners will do with any savings they extract. For almost any news organization looking to the future, the imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that’s where the news audience has been moving to.GateHouse hasn’t been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by Penelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm’s practice after acquiring a newspaper has been to “consolidate copy editing and page design” at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty reporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. “GateHouse-owned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,” Abernathy reported.Reed, who will be the merged company’s chairman, told investors of New Media, the GateHouse parent, on Oct. 31 that the merger would allow the company to quickly pay down debt and “to return capital to shareholders through dividends, in addition to investing for growth that will drive revenues.” It shouldn’t escape notice that it’s not always easy to reconcile using cash to pay shareholder dividends with “investing for growth.”\nThe increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of plunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as a major player in the company through an initial public offering and a bankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract. Fortress will give up the management contract at the end of 2021, but will leave with a payout that New Media investor Leon Cooperman blasted on an investor conference call as “morally wrong.”\n“I know we’re happy to get rid of Fortress,” Cooperman told Reed. “They brought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.5 and they’re going to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. ... They shouldn’t even take the money, given what they’ve done here.” (Cooperman is the billionaire investor who recently tangled with Elizabeth Warren over her proposal for a wealth tax.)Plunder can work as a short-term money-making strategy in an industry that remains profitable while tracing a glide path to extinction. “Financial players like Fortress and Alden are making significant money on the way down,” says Doctor. “They see the way down as close to inevitable.”In the news business that’s a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public companies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have imposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on physical delivery — McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all its newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles online. But they also have invested in investigative reporting and other national-level efforts, as well as digital initiatives.As traditional revenues continue to decline — and at an ever faster pace — those companies find themselves in a vise. Making the transition to digital news requires resources that may be harder to come by. Meanwhile, Doctor says, they’re trying to buy time through shrinkage even as their ultimate destination remains unclear.“After two more years of this,” Doctor asks, “what kind of products are going to be left in local communities that readers feel are worth a digital subscription? What’s your strategy after all the cost-cutting?”\n"

        "articleBody": "AdviceDEAR ABBY: My husband of more than 20 years just purchased plane tickets to India. Itâ€™s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in business class, while Iâ€™m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply doesnâ€™t want to spend it. Heâ€™s older and has health concerns and mobility issues.Am I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than his love for me? Or should I be content and happy Iâ€™m going to a beautiful country? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATEDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a beautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your penny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you than he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You have a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either sit together or heâ€™ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.DEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a restaurant weâ€™ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladiesâ€™ room and was washing my hands when a waitress I donâ€™t care for came barging in, got in my face and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldnâ€™t let me out of the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling me no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.My husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said that I started it. Another waitress who calls me her â€œsisterâ€� didnâ€™t answer the texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she believes the waitress, too.The restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didnâ€™t care. The offender has left town and moved out of state. Iâ€™m 74 and was tempted to go to the police but didnâ€™t. Now I wish I had pressed charges. Should I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIADEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have written, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and falsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to an emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about what the woman did to you.DEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our generation.A few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if her granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had asked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have grandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. -- CONCERNED SISTERDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I donâ€™t think your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was asked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that her granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually active, which made her defensive.Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

        "articleBody": " \n          While Anglophiles spent the weekend watching the third season of The Crown on Netflix, the real Prince Andrew was busy distancing himself from a more sinister style of royal drama.  \n          In an interview about his friendship with billionaire pedophile and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, BBC’s Emily Maitlis did an excellent job pressing Andrew. Maitlis repeatedly demanded how Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's third child, could be so sure what he was doing on the night of March 10, during which he allegedly raped 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring.  \n          Andrew doesn’t remember any raping, but he definitely remembers going to get pizza that night. \"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do,\" he said. \"I remember it weirdly, distinctly.\"  \n          Andrew also spent 45 seconds explaining how he couldn’t have been with Giuffre, because she described him as sweating, and at that point in time, he had a medical condition in which he couldn’t sweat.  \n          “Oh, actually? Yes,” he assures himself. “I didn’t sweat at the time.”  \n          But, to cover his tracks in case the paparazzi catch him sweating, he explained that he can sweat now.  \n          Andrew has no memory of the photograph of himself with Giuffre, either. And if there was any indication of Epstein’s crimes during the years in which they were friends, visiting each other at their respective swanky homes, he simply can’t remember.  \n          “There was no indication, absolutely no indication,” Andrew said. “And if there was, you have to remember that at the time, I was the patron of the [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children’s] ‘Full Stop’ campaign, so I was close-up with what was going on in those — time about getting rid of abuse to children, so I knew what was, what the things were to look for but I never saw them.”  \n          The fact that Andrew was sponsoring a campaign against child cruelty doesn’t seem like a point in his favor. It seems more like a devastating irony.  \n          As if all of this hedging wasn't enough to strengthen suspicion that the accusations are true, Andrew said he doesn’t regret his relationship with Epstein because of \"the opportunities I was given to learn\" about business. In other words, who cares if someone is a sex-trafficking pedophile if they can teach you a bit about profiting off the stock market?  \n          The interview should be a nail in the coffin to Andrew’s apparent guilt in associating with and enabling Epstein for so many years.  \n          \"He knows exactly what he's done,\" Giuffre said before the interview. \"And I hope he comes clean about it.\"  \n          Andrew hasn’t come clean about anything, but his flustered and incoherent denials speak volumes. Let’s hope we see more of Epstein’s associates — from politicians such as Bill Clinton and President Trump to media figures such as Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, and Chelsea Handler — grilled about their connections with him. \n          Unfortunately, Andrew’s interview only appears to have happened thanks to his publicist quitting. After this, Epstein’s powerful friends will be more careful, and no one else will be so foolish as to accidentally admit what appears to be guilt.\n         \n"

Instead, they lost 24-17.\n“We talked all along about everything we wanted was still in front of us,” Lynn said, via the Los Angeles Times. “Yes, we needed to win this game today. I felt like if we could have won this game today and won out, we could control our own destiny. But now, obviously, I don’t feel that way. I still think we have enough to win next week and beyond that, but we probably are going to need some help.”\nAt 4-7, including 2-6 in the AFC and 0-3 in AFC West, the Chargers would probably not make the playoffs even if they win out. And given the way they’ve played so far and the three games remaining against teams with winning records, there’s no reason to think they’ll win out. Lynn is right: The Chargers needed to win that game.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n"

The group stage of qualifying finished on Tuesday, and 20 teams have booked their spots in next summer's tournament, which for the first time will be held across Europe. Wales beat Hungary 2-0 to earn the 20th spot on Tuesday. Aaron Ramsey scored twice for Ryan Giggs' team, as country makes it back to a tournament where it made the semifinals in 2016. The final four spots will come down to next March's Euro 2020 playoffs, whose teams are determined by their performance in the UEFA Nations League. Here's what to know:There's still a chance for these teamsAs it stands, each group of teams below will play a semifinal and final for a spot at the tournament according to UEFA as part of the playoffs, with each path having one berth:Path A: Iceland, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*Path B: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern IrelandPath C: Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Bulgaria/Israel/Hungary/Romania*Path D: Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus  *A draw will decide whether Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania would fill the empty slot in Path C, and which three would go into Path A.    \n\nFour teams from there will join the field of 20.Clinching in NovemberOn Monday, Switzerland and Denmark clinched. Denmark got a 1-1 draw at Ireland, while Switzerland beat Gibraltar 6-0 to win Group D. The day before, Portugal made it as Bruno Fernandes scored the winner in the first half and Cristiano Ronaldo put it away in the second half. Portugal allowed only one shot on goal and converted half of its four chances to make it seven victories out of eight in all competitions. Croatia, Germany, Netherlands and Austria all qualified Saturday. Croatia secured its spot with a 3-1 victory against Slovakia, while Germany's 4-0 rout of Belarus was enough. The Netherlands clinched despite drawing with Northern Ireland, while Austria punched its ticket by beating North Macedonia. On Friday, it was Finland and Sweden's chance. Finland clinched 3-0 against Liechtenstein, while Sweden did the same, 2-0, at Romania. And earlier in the week, Turkey drew Iceland 0-0 in Istanbul to book its spot, and that result also clinched France's ticket to next year's tournament, with the reigning World Cup champs looked at as one of the heavy favorites.

(AP)\n\n\nIn October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents.\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country.\nBorder agents \"say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer, the Wheeling News-Register.\nIs this number correct? It’s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark. \nWe’ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative. \nAs a result, in this fact-check, we’ll interpret McKinley’s comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley’s office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.)\nHere’s the most recent data on drug seizures — cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl — from Customs and Border Protection. \n\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado.\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriff’s office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019.\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\n\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week. \nThat’s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it’s in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time. \n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It’s unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole. \nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico \"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that \"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States.\"\nOur ruling\nMcKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is seized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at about $44 million. That’s smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a reasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value fluctuations and other limitations of the data.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\n\n"

Truck and SUV sales are down 2.6 percent, while sedan sales are down 12.3 percent. Dealers last year sold 303,417 new vehicles, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to InfoNation.\n\n    \n                                            \n                    \n            “People are a little more cautious in regards to purchasing vehicles,” InfoNation President Dan McDowell said, adding, “2019 is just not as strong as 2018.”\n\n    \n                                \n            \n                                \n\n            \n            On HoustonChronicle.com: Car sales plunge nearly 17 percent in August\n\n    \n            The sales slump comes even as the average interest rate on a new vehicle loan stayed below 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The annual percentage rate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.7 percent in October, down from 6.2 percent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com, a California-based automobile data firm.\n\n    \n            Industry experts expect interest rates to remain low as automakers sweeten deals to draw buyers and clear out old inventory toward the end of the year. The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point last month should keep auto interest rates low for the remainder of the year.\n\n    \n                                \n            \n            “The end of the calendar year is a popular time for expensive vehicle purchases,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry analysis, said in a statement. \"Shoppers in the market for a large truck or SUV, or a new luxury vehicle, can look forward to taking advantage of lower financing rates as a bit of an early holiday gift.\"\n\n    \n            On HoustonChronicle.com: Group 1 Auto makes inroads in online sales\n\n    \n            Despite lower interest rates and financing deals, new car prices are climbing. The average retail price of a new vehicle sold locally in October was $39,014, up from $38,373 a year ago and from $34,410 in October 2015.\n\n    \n            The average price of a new truck or SUV sold in October was $41,640 while the average price for a new sedan was $31,627, according to InfoNation. New infotainment and safety technology, such as lane changing alerts, backup cameras, sutomatic braking and self-parking features, have pushed prices up, McDowell said.\n\n    \n                                \n\n            \n            Houston-area fleet sales -- new vehicles sold to corporations and governments -- began trending upwards last month, representing 14.6 percent of all vehicle sales in October. Although fleet sales were up from 13.2 percent in September, it’s still down from the March high of 21.8 percent and the prior 12-month average of 15.2 percent.\n\n    \n            Nationally, dealers sold nearly 17.3 million new vehicles last year, an increase of just 0.3 percent from 2017. Edmunds expects 16.6 million vehicles will be sold this year.\n\n    \n            \n                  paul.takahashi@chron.com\n                  twitter.com/paultakahashi\n                \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t    \n                        \n      \n    \n              \t\t\n    \n\n\n\n\t\t    \n                        \n      \n    \n                  \n                        \n      \n    \n              \n\n    \n                \n                            More Business News\n                        \t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t    \n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n                \n                    Most Popular\n            \n    \n\n    \n\n                \n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n\n\n                            \n      \n  \n    \n                \n          \n      \n                  \n\n  \n\n        \n\n\n            \n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n"

        "articleBody": "How can a duvet affect your lungs when it is too big to go up your nostrils? (Photo: Getty Images)GettyThe Corrs’ song “Breathless” probably doesn’t refer to a duvet. However, it was this type of fluffy bedding that left a man not only breathless but with a serious lung condition, according to a case report published in the journal BMJ Case Reports.Wondering how something so soft and so comfortable could make you sick and even eventually be life-threatening? Well, go on, go on. This case report may leave you breathless.For the case report, Patrick Liu-Shiu-Cheong of Victoria Hospital and Chris RuiWen Kuo, Struan WA Wilkie, and Owen Dempsey of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK told the tale of a 43-year-old man who saw his doctor in November 2016 after three months of feeling very tired and breathless. His doctor initially thought that the man had a lower respiratory tract infection but contrary to the Howard Jones song, things didn’t get better afterwards. In fact, in December 2016, the man returned with worsening breathlessness to the point where he couldn’t walk from one room to another without getting out of breath.Here is how bad things got in the words of the patient: “Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out. Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest. I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep (day and night).”At first glance, the man didn’t have any obvious reasons to be so breathless. He wasn’t a smoker. His workplace didn’t expose him to anything unusual. His main hobby was playing guitar and saxophone for a band, and nothing indicated that he was sticking either of these instruments up his nostrils. Ah, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently “acquired” both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go on, go on.Breathing tests showed that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as much air as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren’t moving as well between his lungs and his blood vessels as they should.A CT of his chest showed a “ground glass” pattern in both of his lungs. Some lymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were consistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but hypersensitivity pneumonitis. HP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your lungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to breathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird droppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers. When the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called “feather duvet lung.” When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is “bird fancier’s lung.” When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called “pigeon breeder’s lung.” If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken costume, well that doesn’t occur often enough to have its own name. Wait there’s more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what’s called “farmer's lung,” not to be confused with a farmer’s tan. “Humidifier lung” may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some similar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is “hot tub lung,” which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn’t. The bacteria in hot tubs can travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it’s not always good if what’s in a hot tub makes you breathless. Not all duvets have real feathers in them. If you are having an allergic reaction, you can try one ... [+] with synthetic stuffing instead. (Photo: Getty Images)GettyThe doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm the reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the feather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling of mold. According to the man, the steroids “had a transformative effect within 2 days. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the allergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.” Eventually everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, “the course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely. My oxygen saturation level nowadays is regularly 97%–98% which I understand to be normal for someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.”Fortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the inflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can result. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible. Not surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life threatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live. So, if something is leaving you breathless and it’s not someone you fancy, you may want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing an allergic reaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest or your cap or anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air conditioner, or the many bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or perhaps it’s the pigeons that you are breeding in your kitchen. Before you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the flocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like “feather duvet lung” are still relatively uncommon. That’s why this case became a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may have seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where even the slightest touch and you feel weak.      \n"

Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed three Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar. \nBoth sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in stalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul government and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group’s 18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops. \nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban’s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla insurgent group’s Haqqani network. \nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a political office, according to a Taliban representative. \nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages “give[s] us hope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United States stands ready to support. \n“We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement.” \nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their ordeal. “We pray for the full recovery of both men,” said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. “We thank the Afghan government for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.” \nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last week, he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to the front line. \nHe also said he hoped the swap would “pave the way” for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate peace with Kabul. \nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, “We are profoundly pleased and relieved” at the hostages’ release, adding that Weeks’ family had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude. \nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart of Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two videos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale and gaunt. \nBoth men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their governments to help in their release — but it’s impossible to know whether they were forced to speak. \nUS officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the hostages at one point that failed to find the hostages. \nWashington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement for US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal when President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\tEarlier this year, Lexus revealed the LC Convertible Concept, essentially an open-top version of the gorgeous LC 500 grand tourer. At the time, Lexus called the vehicle a concept despite looking ready to hit showrooms and streets worldwide.\nNow, at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the Japanese luxury marque has finally pulled the covers off the production model 2020 LC 500 Convertible.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the LC 500 Convertible looks largely similar to the LC Convertible Concept previewed in January. Most of the design cues has simply been carried over. However, it seems the more stylish wheels on the Concept appears to have been ditched in favor of the standard units fitted on the Coupe.\n\nStyling-wise, the biggest difference between the Convertible and the standard LC 500 would be the lack of a roof and a revised rear deck. In place of a fixed metal roof and the large backglass is a retractable fabric soft top. Lexus engineers have hidden the frame underneath the material so that it won’t be seen with the roof in place. No doubt the LC 500 Convertible looks very stylish with the roof down. However, some might find it’s roofline a bit strange with the soft-top roof up.\n\nShould the weather take a turn for the worse, drivers can operate the folding soft-top to close in just 16 seconds at speeds at up to 50 km/h. Meanwhile, it just takes 15 seconds to fold the roof down and give occupant open-air freshness. The air-conditioning system also automatically adjusts cabin temperature whether the top is up or down. The rest of the cabin has simply been carried over from the coupe. \n\n\nIn order to make up for the lack of a roof, Lexus Project Manager Fumihiko Hazama shared with AutoIndustriya.com that they have improved chassis rigidity by adding x-braces. The front suspension has also been revised in order to reduce unsprung weight. At the rear, the suspension brace has been relocated and reshaped in order to improve structural rigidity.\n\nUnder the hood, it’s the same 5.0-liter V8 engine which produces 471 horsepower and 540 Nm of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. To hear the V8 better, a pipe channels engine noise into the cabin. \nThe Lexus LC 500 Convertible will go on sale in summer 2020. Considering how Lexus Philippines offers almost all Lexus models locally, it's possible the LC500 Convertible could arrive in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n"

        "articleBody": "\n\n\tThe Doobie Brothers will unite with former frontman Michael McDonald for a 2020 North American tour celebrating the band’s 50th anniversary. \nSinger-guitarists Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons, singer-keyboardist McDonald, and multi-instrumentalist John McFee will tour together for the first time in nearly 25 years during the trek, which kicks off June 9th in West Palm Beach, Florida, and concludes October 10th in Houston, Texas.\nThe Doobie Brothers announced the 30-date jaunt while closing out their November 18th concert at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, which featured full-LP performances of 1972’s Toulouse Street and 1973’s The Captain and Me. McDonald came out during the encore for a surprise version of their single “Takin’ It to the Streets,” the title track of their 1976 album, the first with McDonald in the lineup.\nFollowing a performance of their sing-along jam “Black Water,” Simmons teed up McDonald’s cameo. “You might remember him from, well, he has his own band these days,” he said. “But you might remember him from his band, the Doobie Brothers — Mr. Michael McDonald.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDressed in black pants, an untucked black shirt, and glasses, the white-haired McDonald took his place at a keyboard at the front of the stage and began the intro to “Takin’ It to the Streets.” The reaction from the crowd, a mix of boomers and nostalgia-loving Gen-X’ers, was rapturous and they called for more even as the lights came up signaling the official end of the night.\nTickets for the 50th anniversary tour go on sale to the general public starting Friday, December 6th, at 10 a.m. local time via Live Nation. \n“We’re truly excited about our 50th Anniversary Tour, as it’s a celebration of the band’s entire history,” Johnston said in a statement. “We’ll be performing songs from our full catalog, as well as new music.”\nMcDonald joined the band in 1975 and initially remained in the lineup until 1982, appearing on four albums and hit singles like 1978’s “What a Fool Believes.” He later performed with the band on multiple occasions.\nThe band’s current tour continues November 19th in Greenville, South Carolina; after a break later that month, the schedule picks up February 7th in Las Vegas.\nThe Doobie Brothers Tour Dates\nJune 9 – West Palm Beach, FL @ Coral Sky Amphitheatre\nJune 10 – Tampa, FL @ MIDFLORIDA Credit Union Amphitheatre\nJune 14 – Alpharetta, GA @ Ameris Bank Amphitheatre (Formerly Verizon Amphitheatre)\nJune 17 – Nashville, TN @ Bridgestone Arena\nJune 19 – Charlotte, NC @ PNC Music Pavilion\nJune 20 – Raleigh, NC @ Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek\nJune 23 – Virginia Beach, VA @ Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater at Virginia Beach\nJune 24 – Bristow, VA @ Jiffy Lube Live\nJune 26 – Allentown, PA @ PPL Center\nJune 27 – Camden, NJ @ BB&T Pavilion\nJune 29 – Holmdel, NJ @ PNC Bank Arts Center\nJune 30 – Wantagh, NY @ Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater\nJuly 2 – Uncasville, CT @ Mohegan Sun Arena\nJuly 3 – Mansfield, MA @ Xfinity Center\nJuly 19 – Toronto, ON @ Budweiser Stage\nJuly 22 – Cuyahoga Falls, OH @ Blossom Music Center\nJuly 26 – Saratoga Springs, NY @ Saratoga Performing Arts Center\nJuly 30 – Noblesville, IN @ Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center\nAugust 2 – Clarkston, MI @ DTE Energy Music Theatre\nAugust 4 – Cincinnati, OH @ Riverbend Music Center\nAugust 8 – Tinley Park, IL @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre – Chicago\nAugust 14 – St. Louis, MO @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre – St. Louis\nAugust 30 – Denver, CO @ Pepsi Center\nSeptember 2 – Salt Lake City, UT @ USANA Amphitheatre\nSeptember 5 – Seattle, WA @ White River Amphitheatre\nSeptember 12 – Mountain View, CA @ Shoreline Amphitheatre\nSeptember 18 – Los Angeles, CA @ The Forum\nOctober 3 – Phoenix, AZ @ Ak-Chin Pavilion\nOctober 9 – Irving, TX @ Toyota Music Factory\nOctober 10 – Houston, TX @ The Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion\n\n\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Hudak\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n"

After all, we should be humble and give the driver some amount of credit, before we decide that we know better than them and say that they are stupidly doing something that’s not in their own best interest.\nLogically, there must be some speed at which it’s no longer better (in terms of overall utility) to be slower — if not, the speed limit would be 1 MPH. Are we sure that those buses are currently travelling above that ideal speed?\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tHave you written anything about the trade-off between giving now vs investing the money and giving in the future?\nIn particular it seems like effective altruism research is still improving quickly, so we might be able to give more effectively in the future.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tHi Alex,\nOur best guess is that any effects on vehicle speed are fairly small. We have limited data on this question; the only information we have is from the 2015 randomized controlled trial (RCT). We write in our report on Zusha!:\nIn Habyarimana & Jack 2015, the authors try to test mechanisms, but the evidence is mixed. There is no significant difference in reports of reckless driving or passenger complaints between the treatment and control vehicles. There is also no significant difference in maximum moving speeds. However, the average moving speed was slower for treatment vehicles than control vehicles, by about 1 km/h on average.\nReductions in average speed at levels similar to that referenced above are small enough that we don’t model the disutility. That said, this study raises the question of the mechanism by which accidents are reduced, if speeds don’t change. Our question about the mechanism by which the reduction in accidents occurred is one of our key uncertainties about the program, and is one of the factors that led us to discount our best-guess effect of the intervention more than for most programs with RCTs we’ve looked at.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tHi Gary,\nWe detailed several considerations related to giving now versus later in this 2011 blog post. \nWe see the following general arguments in favor of giving now and giving later. \nIn favor of giving now:\n* It may become less cost-effective to help people in the future, due to general economic development and improvements in living conditions, and so some of the best opportunities to save or improve a life today may not exist in the future.\n* Accomplishing good today may “earn interest,” by empowering people and positioning them to help others in the future.\nIn favor of giving later:\n* We might find more cost-effective programs in the future, through our Incubation Grants program or by researching and reviewing new areas, such as policy advocacy.\n* An opportunity that looks good now could look worse in the future (for example, because we learn new information or because it runs out of room for more funding).\nOn balance, our best guess is that the benefits of giving now are likely to outweigh the benefits of giving later, although we have a high degree of uncertainty around this. Some of the additional factors raised in the 2011 blog post also point in favor of giving now, such as providing an incentive to think carefully about where to give each year and helping charities plan around your gifts. \nIn addition, here are some resources outside of GiveWell from the effective altruism community that may be of interest in thinking about this question:\n* Effective Altruism Forum roundup of writings on this topic\n* 2015 Global Priorities Project write-up, with flowchart\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tHi,\nI recently stumbled upon this old blog post (https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2012/12/some-general-concerns-about-givewell/) by William MacAskill and was very interested in this remark:\n“GoodVentures’ endowment could easily use up the room for more funding at GiveWell’s top charities. So it raises the question why GoodVentures doesn’t donate to GiveWell’s top charities: even if not exhausting their room for more funding, at least using up a considerable proportion of it. The most plausible explanation in my mind is that GiveWell thinks that GoodVentures can better spend its money at a later date after further research. In which case, it’s hard to see why individual donors shouldn’t save and donate later, or even try to give to GoodVentures. Perhaps that’s wrong, but it’s worthy of discussion.”\nI wanted to know if there had been any further discussion on it by GiveWell or others. If there hasn’t, could GiveWell give a response now? Is the reason GoodVentures is not exhausting its funds to close these gaps every year because they are holding out for a future opportunity? Or is it to strategically leave behind some funding gaps so as to entice individiual donors like myself who are attracted to effectiveness, and thus in the grand scheme of things there will have been moved a greater sum of money in totality?\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tHi Mohammad,\nThanks for your question. \nGood Ventures is a large charitable foundation which works closely with GiveWell, although the two organizations are distinct from one another. Good Ventures sets its overall grantmaking budget independent from GiveWell, according to its own cause prioritization. In 2017, Good Ventures’ giving to GiveWell’s top charities derived from its assumption that, in the long run, 10% of its total available capital would go to “straightforward charity” (as opposed to more speculative causes or worldviews), expected to align with GiveWell’s research and recommendations. You can read about the reasoning for Good Ventures choosing 10% in detail here. \nGiveWell was involved in discussions with Good Ventures about the allocation of this pool of its funding in 2017, but, as we noted in our blog post announcing our updated top charities, “the amount [Good Ventures gave to our recommended charities] was based on discussions about how to allocate funding across time and across cause areas. It was not set based on the total size of top charities’ funding gaps or the projection of what others would give.”\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\tHi Charles,\nWe have not prioritized further investigation into Partners in Health since our 2012 review was published.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tComments are closed.\n"

        "articleBody": "\n\t\tIn July 2018, we recommended a $5.1 million grant to Evidence Action Beta to create a program dedicated to developing potential GiveWell top charities by prototyping, testing, and scaling programs which have the potential to be highly impactful and cost-effective. \nThis grant was made as part of GiveWell’s Incubation Grants program, which aims to support potential future GiveWell top charities and to help grow the pipeline of organizations we can consider for a recommendation. Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we work closely.\nSummary\nThis post will discuss the following:\n\n Why Evidence Action Beta is promising. (More)\n Risks we see with this Incubation Grant. (More)\n Our plans for following Evidence Action Beta’s work going forward. (More)\n\nIncubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up: \n\nA key part of GiveWell’s research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs. GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create … [an] incubator … focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them.\nWe have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, … our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities.\nWe believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling … promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\n\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta’s parent organization, Evidence Action, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water). \nModeling cost-effectiveness\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant’s cost-effectiveness.\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could. \nThis could occur:\n\n if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\n if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities—in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities’ funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities’ funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\n\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn’t direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly.\n\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta’s incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here.)\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research. \nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\nRisks to the success of the grant\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\n\nFew programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell’s 2017 top charities, or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\nWe expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities, end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\n\nGoing forward\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely. \nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.\n\t\t\t\n"

        "articleBody": "The government has unveiled a plan to help the PV industry reduce the cost of solar panels from around $0.23/W to $0.10/W by 2030. The plan also aims to reach module efficiencies of around 24% – up to 35% for multi-junction cells – by the end of the next decade. November 20, 2019 Hanwha Q Cells was reportedly South Korea’s largest cell maker at the end of 2017, with 3.7 GW of annual production capacity.Image: Hanwha Q cellsSouth Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) has unveiled a plan to help the PV industry further reduce the costs of solar module technology and to increase product efficiency.The initiative is part of the Fourth Energy Technology Development Plan and Roadmap, submitted to Korean renewable energy industry representatives this week. The plan includes actions to raise electromobility rates, reduce coal-fired fine dusts by 90%, improve nuclear safety and increase the scale of wind power projects, among other measures.Sixteen energy technology priorities identified by MOTIE in the roadmap include a reduction in solar module costs from around $0.23/W today to $0.10 by 2030, helped by unspecified research and development investment. As a way of rough comparison, the SunShot Initiative launched by the U.S. government in 2011 aims to reduce the price of the solar electricity generated by large scale projects to $0.03/kWh by 2030. In September 2017, the Department of Energy announced the $0.06/kWh benchmark of that ambition had been achieved three years early.Module efficiencyThe South Korean government also wants to help manufacturers increase solar module efficiency from around 20% now to 24% by the end of the next decade. Seoul expects PV cell producers to increase the average efficiency of multi-junction devices from 23% to 35%.No details were provided on how the industrial and technological targets would be achieved.The plan appears consistent with another announced by MOTIE in March, which aimed to introduce carbon footprint certification rules, minimum efficiency levels and industrial standards for solar and wind power. Those planned guidelines are yet to see the light of day.Domestic industryA recent report by the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Program stated the South Korean solar module industry had an annual production capacity of around 8.69 GW at the end of 2017. Hanwha Q Cells had 3.7 GW of cell capacity and the same volume of module operations at that point and LG Electronics had 3 GW of output, also evenly split between cells and modules. A further 17 manufacturers, according to the report, had production operations ranging from 30-600 MW.However, the reduction in demand seen after Beijing attempted to rein in public solar subsidies at the end of May last year ensures some of that 8.69 GW of Korean production lines may have since been idled or closed altogether.South Korea also hosts several polysilicon manufacturers, including the OCI Group and Hanwha Q Cells parent Hanwha Group. That industry too is suffering from oversupply and anti-dumping duties on polysilicon imports by the Chinese government since July 2013.Despite the manufacturing setbacks introduced by its regional neighbor and solar giant, South Korea is seeing stronger than ever solar project deployment. According to data released by MOTIE in August, newly installed capacity for the first seven months of the year reached 1.64 GW and Seoul plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. That ambitious target is expected to be achieved with giant solar parks such as a recently announced 2.1 GW floating solar project and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array planned in the Saemangeum area and announced by president Moon Jae-in a year ago.Emiliano Bellini  Emiliano joined pv magazine in March 2017.  He has been reporting on solar and renewable energy since 2009.More articles from Emiliano Bellini\n"

        "articleBody": "\nBreaking with decades of United States policy favoring free trade, President Donald Trump has pursued an agenda favoring tariffs as weapons in a widening trade war. \n\"We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great betrayal is over,\" Trump said at a rally in Monroe, La., on Nov. 6, 2019. \"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\"\nBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly.\nTariffs have also strengthened the United States’ leverage after massive job losses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of Trump’s tariff decisions.\nMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary victims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while tariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy.\n\"As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\" said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. \"Tariffs, like any tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the trading relationship poorer — not richer.\"\nStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger fraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do.\nThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the United States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the world. \nWho pays the cost of a tariff?\nWhen the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn’t foreign exporters that make the payment. The importers do, and they’re usually U.S. companies.\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer — say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written. \"The Chinese government pays nothing.\"\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don’t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill.\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are high enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It’s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality.\nDon’t tariffs produce revenue?\nRevenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through June 30, 2019. \nThat’s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs. For context, that’s less than 2% of annual federal revenues. \nMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two years.\nHow big an impact have the Trump tariffs had overall?\nAs we’ve noted, a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods, \"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\nSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era tariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by 2020. If that holds up, that would work out to a $75.3 billion dollar hit on economic growth, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who studies U.S.-Canada trade.\nOther estimates are in the same ballpark. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump administration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while lowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent jobs.\nWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too. Facing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer Chinese goods, thereby hurting China’s gross domestic product. \nWhat tariffs has the United States imposed?\nIt started with washing machines and solar panels in February 2018, followed by steel and aluminum in March 2018. \nChina-specific tariffs took effect in July 2018, primarily covering machinery, followed by additional tariffs on China in August 2018 that covered plastics, more machinery, and electrical equipment. \nThe first big expansion into consumer goods from China came in September 2018, affecting home goods, electronics, furniture, backpacks, and other goods. Tariffs on Chinese goods were increased from 10% to 25% in May 2019, and the list of impacted goods expanded in September 2019 to cover some clothes, shoes, televisions and Bluetooth devices. \nTariffs have also been imposed on imports from the European Union, including many food products.\n\"The overall impact is now over $4 billion per month in extra tariffs on a wide range of goods,\" said Daniel Anthony, vice president of the Trade Partnership, a trade-focused consulting firm in Washington. \nWhat are the major products or sectors that have suffered negative impacts from tariffs?\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers. \nU.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. (Bad weather and other factors may have had an impact as well.)\nIn the meantime, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs.\nComputers and electronic devices have seen impacts, too, said Mary E. Lovely, a Syracuse University economist. \"About 36% of imports from China to the U.S. are computers and electronic devices,\" she said.\nAnd U.S. imports of \"intermediate goods\" from China, such as motors, pumps, and semiconductors, have seen price increases, harming U.S. producers. \"When the price of these inputs go up, U.S. businesses find it harder to compete against non-U.S. competitors, even in the U.S. market,\" Lovely said.\n\n"

        "articleBody": "   Express. Home of the Daily and Sunday Express.      A THIRD case of the plague has been reported in China – with the public beginning to panic over the potential outbreak.  PUBLISHED:  00:01, Tue, Nov 19, 2019   | UPDATED: 10:43, Tue, Nov 19, 2019  Health authorities in China’s Inner Mongolia have confirmed that a third instance of the plague has been reported, after two people contracted it in Beijing earlier this month. The health commission said in a statement that a 55-year old man had contracted bubonic plague after eating a wild rabbit during a hunting trip. The man was subsequently quarantined after the diagnosis, along with 28 people who he came into contact with.However, the other 28 people have showed no signs or symptoms of the plague.The other two contractors caught pneumonic plague, with the difference being bubonic effects the lymph nodes whereas pneumonic effects the lungs.Fan Mengguang, deputy director of Inner Mongolia’s disease prevention and control centre, told the media that the latest case is “isolated and unrelated” to the cases in Beijing.However, with three confirmed diagnoses, the public is beginning to panic over a potential outbreak.  Yersina pestis causes the plague (Image: GETTY)  The plague wiped out half of Europe in the 14th century (Image: GETTY)According to AFP, one user on Weibo, which is essentially China’s version of Twitter, posted: “I just want to know how these two came to Beijing?? By train, airplane, or did they drive themselves?”Another reportedly said: ”Bird flu in the year of the rooster... swine fever in the year of the pig. Next year is the year of the rat...the plague is coming.”The pneumonic plague is just one of three diseases caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium.Pneumonic plague is known for its effects on the respiratory system, as it causes dangerous lung infections.READ MORE: China plague outbreak confirmed: Two diagnosed with disease in Beijing  Plague can be easily vaccinated (Image: GETTY)Yersinia pestis also causes bubonic plague - otherwise known as the ‘black death - which affects lymph nodes, and septicemic plague, which affects the blood.Of the three plague variants, pneumonic is the most virulent and is fatal if left untreated.In the 14th century the Black Death spread across the Mediterranean and Europe, killing up to 60 percent of Europe’s total population.More than 100 million people may have perished - reducing the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million.DON'T MISSPlague and zoonotic influenza warning: CDC names EIGHT deadly diseases [WARNING]BLACK DEATH PLAGUE fears: Holidaymakers die after eating marmot [INSIGHT]Plane passengers quarantined after BUBONIC PLAGUE outbreak [NEWS]  A 14th century plague doctor (Image: GETTY)According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the US, the plague is treatable with antibiotics.The CDC advises the earlier people seek treatment, the more likely it is they will make a full recovery.Those who come into close contact with plague victims may need preventative antibiotic therapy.

The layoffs are part of an effort by the struggling office-space company to cut costs, close ancillary businesses and narrow its offering to subletting office space.\nWeWork chairman Marcelo Claure (Credit: Getty Images)\nIn a company email sent by chairman Marcelo Claure, employees were told that layoffs will begin this week in the U.S., and that a planned all-hands meeting will be postponed from Tuesday to Friday, where Claure will present the companyâ€™s five-year plan.\nâ€œIn the areas of the business that do not directly support our core business goals, we have to make some necessary job eliminations,â€� Claure said in the email, which was seen by The Real Deal. â€œWe are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and responsibilities, which will increase efficiency and also accountability.â€�\nA person familiar with the matter told TRD that employees in the legal and human resources departments will begin receiving notice Monday.\nWeWork declined to comment.\nWeWork employees have waited weeks to hear notice of the layoffs, since the company abandoned plans for an IPO and had its valuation slashed from $47 billion to $8 billion. After CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann left the company in October, SoftBank, its largest investor, committed to a $9.5 billion lifeline to bail out the company, and installed a Claure to implement a turnaround strategy.\nIn sum, more than 4,000 people are expected to receive notice in the coming weeks, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\nThose include 1,000 maintenance workers who have been informed that their employment will be terminated on Dec. 9, according to a group of employees. The group, WeWorkers Coalition, formed in recent weeks and sent a letter to management earlier this month stating that they â€œdonâ€™t want to be defined by the scandals, the corruption and the greed exhibited by the companyâ€™s leadership.â€�\nThe group announced over the weekend that WeWork had reached an agreement with JLL to accept close to 1,000 maintenance and cleaning workers, many of whom would then be contracted to work in WeWork buildings.\nHowever, the group raised alarm at the terms of the deal, and said that employees were told by WeWork to sign the terms of the contract by Monday, otherwise it would consider their resignations voluntary. The group said on Twitter that the contract has confused employees with pay discrepancies, and demanded a deadline extension.\nIn a separate tweet, the group added that WeWork â€œis not following through on its promise to treat employees with â€˜dignity and respectâ€™ during this restructuring process.â€�\nMany employees and shareholders with stock options are also waiting to hear when a $3 billion tender offer by SoftBank will be launched, after being delayed for almost two weeks.\n  \n"

A 43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling extreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet lung,\" according to a new case report.Â The patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained malaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.The man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"Related: 7 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic ReactionHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed CT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.Â After questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather bedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a compound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was diagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.Feather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"The patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.Â \"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study.Â It's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\"Â When doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.That being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.The findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports.27 Oddest Medical Case Reports10 Strangest Medical Cases11 Weird Things People Have SwallowedOriginally published on Live Science.Want more science?

        "articleBody": "\n\nThe core stage of the first SLS at Michoud Assembly Facility after the installation in early November of its four RS-25 engines. (credit: NASA/Jude Guidry)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of its long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four RS-25 engines into the rocketâ€™s core stage. With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a â€œGreen Runâ€� test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch.\n\n\nâ€œIf NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,â€� Cooke said.\n\n\nThe SLS has been a key part of NASAâ€™s exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX.\n\n\n\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isnâ€™t using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches.\n\n\n\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administrationâ€™s own party in Congress. â€œEvery space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,â€� said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committeeâ€™s space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASAâ€™s exploration plans.\n\n\n\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASAâ€™s Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.)\n\n\n\nâ€œWhile I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,â€� he continued.\n\n\n\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASAâ€™s approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASAâ€™s current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\n\n\n\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. â€œThe fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,â€� said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee. (Cookeâ€™s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS core stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views long before working with Boeing.)\n\n\nâ€œIf you donâ€™t have a big booster, youâ€™re not going to make it,â€� Stafford said of returning to the Moon.\n\n\nâ€œSLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry Orion,â€� he continued. â€œIf NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date.â€� He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two SLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the two rendezvousing in lunar orbitâ€”no Gateway required.\n\n\n\nAt last weekâ€™s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom Stafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them about the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission safety.\n\n\n\nâ€œThe mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,â€� Stafford, a member of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cookeâ€™s earlier testimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success with the current multiple-launch approach. â€œI cannot disagree with it.â€�\n\n\n\nâ€œBut with eight launches, Iâ€™ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of success goes down to about 50 percent,â€� he concluded.\n\n\n\nâ€œOh my,â€� Lucas responded with a sigh.\n\n\n\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-lift launch vehicle. â€œIf you donâ€™t have a big booster, youâ€™re not going to make it,â€� he said. â€œYou have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big, wide-diameter booster. If you donâ€™t have it, youâ€™re not going to make it.â€�\n\n\n\nYoung, in his testimony, didnâ€™t specifically address the use of SLS versus commercial rockets, but did criticize what he called â€œexperimentsâ€� in procurement. â€œManaging and contracting experiments must be excluded from the Mars-Moon program,â€� he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment, he brought up the HLS program.\n\n\n\nâ€œA management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to the surface of the Moon,â€� he said. â€œI personally think that these should be government-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.â€�\n\n\n\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human spaceflight. â€œThe plate is really full today,â€� he said. â€œI personally think that the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number two is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done that will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.â€�\n\n\n\nOne thing Young would push off NASAâ€™s plate is the Gateway. â€œI do not really see a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,â€� he said, although it could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. â€œThereâ€™s not a compelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.â€�\n\n\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. â€œAdding an additional SLS into the mix couldâ€”Iâ€™m not confident that could happen.â€�\n\n\nLast weekâ€™s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of Congress questioned NASAâ€™s useâ€”or unwillingness to useâ€”the SLS. At a hearing last month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater use of SLS.\n\n\n\nâ€œI understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for SLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,â€� he said, including the first Block 1B. â€œWhat do you think?â€�\n\n\n\nâ€œIt depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,â€� responded NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasnâ€™t funding to support that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n\n\n\nâ€œWe havenâ€™t seen the performance yet that would indicate that weâ€™re guaranteed the second core weâ€™d need for a Moon landing in 2024,â€� added Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA and the other witness at the hearing.\n\n\n\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced by 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first crewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024 that would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface of the Moon. â€œAdding an additional SLS into the mix couldâ€”Iâ€™m not confident that could happen.â€�\n\n\n\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. â€œWhat commercial launch vehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to launch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the Moon by 2024?â€�\n\n\n\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But for the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy and Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from Blue Origin, and Northrop Grummanâ€™s OmegA. \n\n\n\nâ€œThere could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,â€� Bridenstine added. â€œWeâ€™re not shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some investment from Boeing to achieve.â€�\n\n\n\nâ€œWhat is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not available by 2024,â€� Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy is, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehiclesâ€”or SLS.\n\n\n\nâ€œBut if commercialâ€™s not available, whatâ€™s the contingency plan?â€� Aderholt asked again.\n\n\n\nâ€œI think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing in 2024 very, very difficult,â€� Bridenstine said. â€œIf we donâ€™t have the additional rockets, then weâ€™re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu weâ€™re confident weâ€™ll have those rockets.â€�\n\n\nâ€œIf this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,â€� Babin said of potential spending shortfalls for Artemis.\n\n\nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets, citing Cookeâ€™s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged that more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall architecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more launches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n\n\n\nâ€œWeâ€™re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing System how their systems ought to be developed,â€� Bridenstine said. â€œWeâ€™re waiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then weâ€™ll assess their approaches.â€�\n\n\n\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that its approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day the proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would involve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n\n\n\nâ€œUsing the lift capability of NASAâ€™s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have developed a â€˜Fewest Steps to the Moonâ€™ approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,â€� Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\n\n\n\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the â€œnational teamâ€� led by Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Originâ€™s New Glenn vehicles would be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely believed to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that.)\n\n\n\nNASAâ€™s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House nor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion budget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis on track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. JosÃ© Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose.\n\n\n\nâ€œItâ€™s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we donâ€™t know the costs down the road,â€� Serrano said. He suggested pushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to this March, â€œin order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.â€�\n\n\n\nBabin referred to those comments at last weekâ€™s hearing, concluding that the odds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were â€�dwindling.â€�\n\n\n\nâ€œIf this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,â€� he said. â€œThis could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments already made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.â€�\n\n\n\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASAâ€™s architecture for returning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also include revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

        "articleBody": " \n                \n                    South Dakota’s viral “Meth. We’re on it.” awareness campaign has been facing backlash and mockery since introduced on Monday, but Michelle Hege’s response was concern. \nHege is the CEO of DH, the Spokane advertising, public relations and branding firm behind the Washington Healthcare Authority’s Opioid Prevention campaign “Starts with one.”\n“I guess my first reaction was, ‘Oh no, they’re going to get a lot of attention and, maybe, not all of it helpful attention,’ ” Hege said. “At the end of the day, the proof’s in the pudding. I’m sure they’ve got a good evaluation plan in place to look at results over time, but I did feel concerned that it may just create noise that doesn’t actually drive the behaviors that they’re looking to drive.”\nWhen developing the “Starts with one” campaign – which will be in its third year in January – DH did extensive research into the targeted audiences,  working with them  directly to understand their knowledge, beliefs and values regarding opioid misuse. Selling a product is difficult, but altering behavior is much more difficult, Hege said.\n“It’s difficult to change people’s behaviors, but this is also some of the most important advertising and communications work that’s out there,” Hege said. “This is our favorite kind of work to do because it’s a way to make a positive impact in the world.”\nWhile the  “Meth. We’re on it.” campaign did not appeal to Julie Graham, Washington State Department of Health public information officer, she said she did not want to judge the campaign, and thinks it could still be successful for its audience.\n“When a group is trying to reach a very specific audience, the messaging can either be offensive or really miss the mark with the audience that’s not intended to see it,” Graham said. \nGraham said she once encountered backlash for an HIV prevention campaign that encouraged those recently released from jail to use condoms and receive screenings.\n“You might need to have a message that’s very unique to the population that might be at risk, and then you would want to put it in a place where you felt like it would have the best chance of reaching that audience, so you might have a little edgier message,” Graham said. “If somebody from the general public saw it, they might think, ‘Wow this is a little over the edge’ or they might think, ‘Why are they putting it here?’ It’s because it’s meant for a specific population.”\nTargeting audiences is key in making dollars go further, Graham said, offering the example of a recent  domestic violence prevention campaign.\n“We were trying to reach young males, and we were doing our advertising on gaming sites, because we did some research that showed that that’s where a lot of young men were spending more time,” Graham said. “It can seem like there’s a thousand choices for where to put your money and where your audience might be looking now, but there is a benefit in having choices that are very audience-centric.”\nJeff Sanborn, president of Chapter & Verse, a Spokane and Seattle advertising and design agency, said he thought  South Dakota’s campaign – run by a Minneapolis-based firm with a budget of $449,000 – was meant to raise eyebrows.\nOn Tuesday morning, he posted materials from the campaign on the wall by the dining table of the company’s kitchen, where he  posts new marketing findings and other things for  members of his firm to ponder.\n“OK, great, let’s be provocative, let’s get people to notice it and talk about it, but I don’t think people are talking about it in the way that you want them talking about it, right?” Sanborn said. “What’s America talking about? South Dakota’s got a meth problem, so that’s not the best thing for the South Dakota brand.”\nSanborn said the campaign made the mistake of burying the message. That message is that anyone using meth is a problem for everyone and “we want to try to help,” Sanborn said. \n“The problem is, we tell clients all the time, they’ll put the heart of their message somewhere deep in their third paragraph,” Sanborn said. “If that’s the core and heart of your message, you better make that the five words that everybody in America reads.”\n                \n                \n                \n            \n"

The five companies can now vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to pave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Expanding the group of companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon's surface drives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers. We anticipate opportunities to deliver a wide range of science and technology payloads to help make our vision for lunar exploration a reality and advance our goal of sending humans to explore Mars.\"Related:Â SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy Mars Rocket in PicturesThe five companies join nine others selected by CLPS in November 2018, bringing the total number of private moon lander hopefuls to 14 firms.Â The newly selected five are:Â Image 1 of 5NASA has picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems to build the private moon landers needed to help return astronauts to the moon in 2024.(Image credit: Future/SpaceX/Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada)Image 2 of 5An artist's concept of Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander.(Image credit: Blue Origin)Image 3 of 5This Sierra Nevada Corp. illustration shows a concept of the company's commercial lunar lander for NASA.(Image credit: Sierra Nevada Corp.)Image 4 of 5An artist's concept of a Ceres Robotics moon lander and lunar rover on the moon's surface.(Image credit: Ceres Robotics)Image 5 of 5This illustration shows a concept moon lander by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.(Image credit: Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc.)Blue Origin, Kent, WashingtonCeres Robotics, Palo Alto, CaliforniaSierra Nevada Corporation, Louisville, ColoradoSpaceX, Hawthorne, CaliforniaTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc., Irvine, CaliforniaThey include moon lander concepts of all sizes. They range from the truly massive â€” SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle â€” to land multiple rovers on the moon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems.Â \"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of private industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the statement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, weâ€™ll expand our ability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and support human exploration objectives.\"Blue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle, which the company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.Â Sierra Nevada Corp. and CeresÂ Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that could potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.Â NASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to deliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power stations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.Â NASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through November 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the program can bid on NASA delivery services.Â \"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\" Clarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to really broaden the pool â€” to bring on additional capabilities with new, innovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"In July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding lander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond. Orbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on future opportunities.\"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new technology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do much more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our commercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the statement.Artemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by 2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by 2028.Â Such activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on Mars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have stressed.NASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers. This past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build prototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the Artemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early next year.Moon Rush: Private Lunar Lander PlansHere's Where Commercial Landers Will Land on the Moon for NASAÂ NASA: The International Space Station Is Open for Business in OrbitEditor's note: This story was updated at 5:45 p.m. ET to include details from the NASA telecon.Email Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow himÂ @tariqjmalik.Â Follow us on Twitter @Spacedotcom and on Facebook.

        "articleBody": "Business focus is why some people are able to build the online business they dream of while others think about it … but never actually create it?And why is it that some people are able to build an online presence … but never get it to the level where they can live off the revenue it creates?Why — especially — does it seem like certain people come out of nowhere and claim their place in your area of expertise before you’ve had a chance to claim it yourself?So frustrating …Welcome to my business focus strategy lessonToday, we’re going to talk about why focus is important for success. Why it’s crucial, actually!If we haven’t met yet, my name is Pamela Wilson — and I have been working online since 2010.I’m a three-time author, a keynote speaker, and an online educator, coach, and mastermind group leader.I help people build online businesses they love.In this article, and in the coming weeks, I’m sharing my approach to online business growth.It was born from helping thousands of people create the online presence they’ve dreamt of — and seeing way too many of them lose focus and struggle to get any results at all.Once you understand my simple approach, you’ll feel much better about where you are in the online business growth process — and that’s a promise.How can I promise you’re about to feel better?Because once you understand my approach …You’ll recognize you don’t have to master everything about online business all at onceYour to-do list will shrink to 25% of its current sizeYou’ll be able to safely ignore 75% of the online information you’re seeing right nowGet ready to start enjoying the process of building your online business — maybe for the first time ever!If you are …Trying to build an online business because you have deep expertise on a specific topic — but you’re “on hold” because you’re feeling overwhelmedWanting to leave a legacy of information and guidance around a topic you’re passionate about — but you don’t know where to startPassionate about the business idea you’ve imagined — but unsure about how to make it happen… stick around.

Not paying attention to this will virtually guarantee that you will stay stuck where you are.And you’ll have a lot less money in your bank account.Here’s the thing …When you step into the online space, you’ll meet a whole new cast of characters. And they will try to sell you some pretty compelling stories.I'm here to tell you that the Laws of Physics apply to online business just like offline business.Click To TweetIt takes time to build a successful business — offline and online.(I know, radical statement, right?)I want you to embrace this reality — because I’m about to show you how to get time on your side.Trying to build an online business isn’t as simple as lots of people would have you believe. It has its challenges.There’s a lot of technology to master. There’s marketing involved — a lot of marketing. Maybe more marketing than you’re comfortable with.And there are all these moving parts — disparate bits of software that needs to interact to present your business and your offers seamlessly.Today, I’m going to demystify the process of building your online business.You’re about to save some major frustration, my friend. Money, too! Because it turns out your don’t need to Buy All The Things and Learn All The Things in order to make it online.I developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and error — mine, and the people I taught.It’s called Plan & Grow BIG.Focus on what really matters in the near future of your businessPlan & Grow BIG helps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might be stopping you from making real progress in your online business.Maybe you’re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you’ve been trying for years to build a business idea you’ve had in your head — but it just isn’t living up to what you expected.Either way, you’re in the right place because today’s information will help you catapult forward.I developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting sidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they “needed” to master.For example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads — before they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were going to offer.And I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was proven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an unproven product.)I saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. 🙁Smart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But they were completely baffled by this “online business thing.”To be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the frustrations myself.True confession: I had to learn business focus the hard wayBefore I outline the Plan & Grow BIG approach and the specifics for each stage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out.I’m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this.Back in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business, Zurek Design.I had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled projects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also juggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their “launch” phases — they were in high school and starting to look at universities and think about their careers.I didn’t have a lot of time to spare.Plus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become much more of a “public figure” than I had ever had to be in my business in the past. I’d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And I’d need to “put myself out there” on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars, and in online video.Yikes.And although my offline business was making a solid income, my online business idea — to share my marketing and design training with others — wasn’t making a single cent.Who in their right mind invests in a business idea before they know if it will make money?I do, apparently!It turns out that I was more courageous than I knew.Because I did — I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course called Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time — an enormous amount of money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point.But I’m glad I did.I truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that investment, I was telling myself, “This dream matters. This dream is going to become a reality. I’m taking this seriously.”Once I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new, things started happening for me.Within a few months, I (the person who didn’t want to be seen online) had an article accepted by the company behind the course I took — on one of the most-popular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger.Then another article went live. And another.Not just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the day.And through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then coaching.Out with the old, in with the new (and better)Within a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline business made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to focus exclusively on my online efforts.Now, I’m considered an authority on building an online presence.That company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach their audience for a couple of years.Here’s what’s different in my life now:My business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas)I am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from meMy books are well-received and much loved — and deliver income to me every single monthPeople find my website and join my community every day, all year longI’m able to travel anywhere I’d like because my business fits in my backpackI can “dial up” or “dial back” my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my scheduleHere’s the other important thing …I also have complete control over the direction I take my business. I answer to no one but myself! And I can adapt my offerings to what my audience needs whenever I’d like.But this story isn’t about me.What I’m about to share is the exact plan I’ve developed after seeing what truly works online.It’s the approach that has allowed me to build the business I have today. A business where I’m in control — of my time, my projects, my earnings.And that’s what I want for you.Ready to make online business building easier?You wouldn’t have read this far if you didn’t also want to build this kind of online business!That’s why I want to make it easier for you.What is your business focus right now?If you can’t answer that question immediately, read on.How to use Plan & Grow BIG to get the business focus mindset you needThe purpose of the Plan & Grow BIG approach is to help you develop business focus — and eliminate the feeling of overwhelm that keeps you from making progress.Here’s the thing:I believe the #1 enemy of online progress is the flood of information about online business tactics that bombards us every day.Click To TweetI want to show you how you can ignore most of the information you see!And how developing business focus will allow you to build the business you’re dreaming about much faster — and with less frustration.To get started, I created a simple quiz and resource doc that will help you get more value from this article.Grab my 12-question quiz that will help you pinpoint the stage you’re in right now — and get guidance about how to maximize your results.GET THE QUIZ: INSTANT DOWNLOAD!Click the link above so you can:Discover what business-building stage you’re in nowAssess what you’re starting with — make a list of your current assetsPinpoint what your current business focus should beGet to know what happens in the other business stages — so you can focusDownload it here so you can apply this to your business:GET THE QUIZ: INSTANT DOWNLOAD!As we go through each stage of the Plan & Grow BIG approach, I want you to identify areas of opportunity for your current situation.Let’s get started.The four simple stages of Plan & Grow BIGThe Plan Stage: Think and dream productivelyIt’s the early days of your business.Think BIG. And work only on what’s needed in this stage.In the PLAN stage, make these your business focus:Pinpoint your ideal customer: Who will your online business serve? Warning: many people try to skip this step — don’t! You need to become acquainted with the people you want to reach and help before you build your branding and offers.Get your branding in place: The earlier the better when it comes tobuilding your brand. You’ll want to decide your business name andtagline, select your brand colors, and choose your brand fonts.Map out your first offer: Decide how what solutions you’ll deliver and how you’ll deliver them. Will they be products, services, or both?That’s it. Once you’ve completed the items above, it’s time to start building your business, my friend. Ready?The Build Stage: Create a tangible online assetTime to make ideas real. As you build these tangible business assets, remember: you don’t have to do it all at once.Focus on these business goals during the BUILD stage:Build your initial website: You’ll need a Homepage, an About page, a Contact page, and some kind of “commerce” page, like a Store or Services page. Attract prospects by publishing regular content like blog articles, podcast episodes, or a video series.Build your first offer: Don’t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that’s relatively simple — but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that.Build an initial funnel: Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers.And now … stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it’s tempting to look around at Version 9.0 of your competitors’ sites and feel like you have to catch up to them.Nonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and be proud you’re ready to move on …The Implement Stage: Iterate to find what worksOooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can feel deeply uncomfortable.But growth usually does feel uncomfortable, doesn’t it?The IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that’s perfectly fine. Here’s what you’ll focus on while you’re there:Make your offers live: Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great — but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs.Focus on building your email list. Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list — think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a referral network.Discover what works for launching your products and services. Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience.Remember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to develop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business. Patience, my friend!But once you’ve hit on a winning product or service, you’ll be ready for …The Grow Stage: Leverage your successIn the GROW stage, you’ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably in your business — and now you’ll focus on leveraging that success.Improve your conversion rates: Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what’s working. You’ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible.Add more revenue streams: As you dial into what’s working well, you may uncover your customers’ unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You’ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream.The GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are reliable and you’re able to make some serious investments in your business.Ready? Set? Business focus!Now that you know your business stage (you DID download the quiz, right?), you can tap into the power of focused attention and make fast progress. Ignore all the techniques you’ll need in future stages, and just aim to master the stage you’re in.Get the Online Business Success Roadmap for an overview and a handy checklist of all the Plan & Grow BIG stages.When you do this, you can count on steady business growth — with less frustration and more confidence because you’re focused on the right thing at the right time.The next BIG challenge is …Now that you’re clear about how to use a focused approach to eliminate frustration and make faster progress, here’s the next big online business challenge …Becoming a “visible” and public leader in your space.This was a HUGE stumbling block for me.In the next article, I’m going to share my mindset tips and tricks to help you become more comfortable with becoming a visible online leader.

During that time, the officers should have conducted five separate inmate counts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly showed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night, according to court documents. \n        \n    \n        \n            “As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,” Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news release. “Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.”\n        \n    \n        \n            Each defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records. Noel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is charged with three.\n        \n    \n        \n            The conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the charges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n        \n    \n        \n            Noel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday afternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond within a week.\n        \n    \n        \n            Epstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many victims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related conspiracy charges.\n        \n    \n        \n            His suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered multiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations at the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\n        \n    \n        \n            Indictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress \n        \n    \n        \n            As the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage over the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\n        \n    \n        \n            Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the prison system.\n        \n    \n        \n            \"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer, repeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track of such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify against his other co-conspirators.\" \n        \n    \n        \n            Prosecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from at least 2002 to 2005. \n        \n    \n        \n            Sasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n        \n    \n        \n            \"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they’re not the end of this. \n        \n    \n        \n            \"These guards aren’t the only ones who should stand trial – every one of Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars,” Sasse said.\n        \n    \n        \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n        \n            Hawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation and a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she acknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other instances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and falsified records to show that they had.\n        \n    \n        \n            \"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This incident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when something bad happens.\"\n        \n    \n        \n            Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems within the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\"\n        \n    \n        \n            Although representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier may have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports anything other than suicide.\n        \n    \n        \n            Internal memo: Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts\n        \n    \n        \n            Investigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\n        \n    \n        \n            Before New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself with a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered.\n        \n    \n        \n            For months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned to Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\n        \n    \n        \n            Tuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks.\n        \n    \n        \n            \"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do any rounds.\"\n        \n    \n        \n            Roughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters’ questions.\n        \n    \n        \n            Defense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. “It is our hope that we’ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,” said Jason Foy, who represents Noel. \n        \n    \n        \n            Montell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would “ruin his life.”\n        \n    \n        \n            “We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,” Figgins said.\n        \n    \n        \n            Sometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they’re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they’re going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?”\n        \n    \n        \n            Figgins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died. “When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you’ll have a different appreciation for what was going on.”\n        \n    \n        \n            Prisons plagued by understaffing\n        \n    \n        \n            Prison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised security at the Manhattan facility.\n        \n    \n        \n            Staffers 'don't care': Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n        \n    \n        \n            At the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union. Prison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said.\n        \n    \n        \n            Ten of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, the one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.\n        \n    \n        \n            After Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\n        \n    \n        \n            Hawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system.\n        \n    \n        \n            Many of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center. \n        \n    \n        \n            After the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public’s trust in us.”\n        \n    \n        \n            Epstein's inner circle eyed: Jeffrey Epstein is dead.

That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring  days later, which has drawn investigative interest. \n        \n    \n        \n            Experts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n        \n    \n        \n            “When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego.\n        \n    \n        \n            Boesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt.\n        \n    \n        \n            Jack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death. \n        \n    \n        \n            \n“Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.”\n        \n    \n        \n            Contributing: Kristine Phillips\n        \n    \n        \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n            \n        \n"

        "articleBody": "В восьмидесятых годах чешская красавица заявила о себе на весь мир. Тогда трудно было найти журнал, на страницах которого не было бы фотографий Полины. Затем девушка подалась в мир кино. Она снималась у многих режиссеров (например, у Кустурицы в «Аризонской мечте»), а ее партнерами по фильмам становились Джонни Депп и Микки Рурк.Сейчас Полине исполнилось 53 года, и хоть выглядит она до сих пор на все сто, ее охватила настоящая паника.Разве этой красотке дашь 53 года?В интервью модель призналась, что жутко боится старости. «Когда вся ваша жизнь состояла в том, чтобы выглядеть хорошо, стареть публично – это ужасно. Это не для слабонервных, – пожаловалась Поризкова. — Я постоянно борюсь с собой, внутренне говоря: «Да ладно, красота не так уж важна! Отпусти ее и сосредоточься больше на том, что еще можно сделать!»Но пока у модели это не получается. Она откровенно рассказала, что, хоть пока и не колола ботокс, постоянно прибегает к тем или иным процедурам красоты, чтобы сохранить молодость как можно дольше, и тратит на это почти все свободное время.«Я лично ненавижу, когда вижу, что кто-то сделал и пластику, и уколы для сохранения красоты, но они утверждают, что причина, по которой они так хорошо выглядят, – это йога и вода. Сразу понятно, что они врут».Бывшая супермодель призналась, что боится: люди высмеивают то, как она выглядит сейчас. «Я думаю, что кто-то сейчас скажет: эй, посмотри на эту красивую женщину, которая превратилась в эту отвратительную старуху».Но нам кажется, Поризкова слегка лукавит. Старухой ее назвать ни у кого язык не повернется. Полина до сих пор позирует для глянцевых журналов и выглядит лучше многих молодых моделей. Между прочим, некоторые фотосеты весьма провокационны. Например, она приняла участие в проекте для модного издания. Вместо одежды на телах моделей были лишь надписи, отражавшие самые важные для них ценности. Поризкова выбрала слово «Правда».Да и муж Полины до сих пор просто обожает ее. Поризкова и музыкант Рик Оказек поженились еще на заре ее карьеры и уже почти 30 лет счастливы в браке. Да и кто бы не гордился такой красавицей-женой!\n"

        "articleBody": "US President Donald Trump has claimed victory as the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives concluded its third public hearing on the impeachment proceedings against him for allegedly abusing his office for political gain in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.\nThe impeachment hearings are an effort by Democrats to establish whether Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine to pressure the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky into announcing a corruption inquiry into Joe Biden, Trump's leading Democratic rival in the poll.\nThe Democrats are alleging that Trump's call with his Ukrainian counterpart was irregular and inappropriate and abuse of his office for political gain. \"A great day for Republicans, a great day for our Country! In the end, we will win and save our Country from certain destruction,â€� Trump tweeted soon after the House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public impeachment hearings on Tuesday.\nIn the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer Williams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\nLater in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison, another top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\nThe White House called the impeachment process a sham.\n\"Today's second hearing is over, and the Democratsâ€™ central allegation in this impeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\nâ€œSpecifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no indication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating his previous deposition testimony that â€˜there was no linkage like that,\" she said.\nGrisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the Democrats.\nâ€œWith the Democratsâ€™ poll-tested â€˜quid-pro-quoâ€™ and â€˜briberyâ€™ narratives in shambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for one more second,â€� Grisham said.\nâ€œWe have learned nothing new in today's illegitimate â€˜impeachmentâ€™ proceedings. However, buried among the witnessesâ€™ personal opinions and conjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both witnesses testified the July 25 transcript was â€˜accurateâ€™ and nothing President Trump has done or said amounts to â€˜briberyâ€™ or any other crime,â€� she added.\nGrisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for President Trump.\nâ€œToday's hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats are simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to overturn the outcome of a free and fair election,â€� Grisham said.\nHowever, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trumpâ€™s request to Ukrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\nVolker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with American national security goals.\nâ€œFrankly I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of shock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security,â€� Vindman said.\nWilliams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\nâ€œI believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the president's reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different than other calls I had listened to,â€� she said.\nâ€œI thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such as former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature given that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,â€� Williams said.\nâ€œI can't speak to what the president's motivation was in referencing it, but I just noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,â€� she said in response to a question.\nDuring the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly the former prosecutor general, are they're not things that one should be pursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\nâ€œWe should be supporting Ukraine's democracy, reforms, and its own fight against corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense capabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing, and I don't think pursuing these things serves a national interest,â€� Volker said.\n\n"

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow do you shop for a tech-savvy person who buys the latest of everything before the holidays arrive? I am totally that person for my family when it comes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\nThere are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store gift cards and another HomePod, but stocking stuffers and expensive smart speakers aren’t always the right gift.\nThat’s why I’m approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different. Last year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home products, and most of those picks are still applicable.\nBut there’s also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I’ve received for testing — new technology that I’m super glad to see exist. Read on to see my favorite picks for new tech that I’m grateful for this year.\n\nSatechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\nApple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C on MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple laptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\nThe only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook would struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs. A better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage, and now it’s totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit while charging in the car.\n\nSatechi’s awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I’ve tested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It features two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you charge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro — even during use.\nIt’s amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I’m still amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro when just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery percentage while charging.\nAnker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and another with dual 18W USB-C PD ports, but neither match the 60W output from Satechi.\nRAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\nIt’s not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air and MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year — not in terms of power delivery but in miniaturization.\nThanks to new GaN (gallium nitride) charging bricks, you can find fast and reliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than what Apple includes in the box.\n\nRAVPower’s 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I’ve bought two so far and am just a few clicks away from owning a third.\nThe $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact that it’s black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple’s chargers pleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials USB-C charging cable, available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\nThe all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my top tech discoveries this year.\nMophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\nThis is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat project first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to fill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\nWhile no one has matched Apple’s vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless charging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that stands out.\n\nMophie’s recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot for charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging Case, and iPhone 8 or later. It’s not cheap at $140, but it’s very nice to own and makes for a great gift.\nThis has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a couple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my nightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\n\nPrior to Mophie’s solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad’s version (pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience, but I prefer the tighter design of Mophie’s personally. If you don’t need the Apple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless charging mat with a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for $60 less.\nEven with Apple’s AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward this year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods, Apple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless charger on my nightstand.\nSamsung 4K Smart LED TV\nSpeaking of one year ago, I definitely didn’t expect to ever include a Samsung TV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple introduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\nSamsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending audio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\nRecent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV shows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and even watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple TV Channels.\n\nOn the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed over to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try. That turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for $278.\nFor context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200 before you factor the cost of a new TV.\n\nI’ve been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since AirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly recommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room without spending a fortune.\nLinksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\nWi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next generation of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\nPrior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this year. Wireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than 802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take advantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery between multiple mesh routers).\nThen the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices with Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we’re sure to see more Apple hardware join next year.\n\nIf you’re considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to treat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a future pick this year that you can buy now.\nI’ve been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400, currently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and early results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as your tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\nIf Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh bang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 5 mesh router two-pack.\nLogitech MX Master 3 Mouse\nMy two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse that came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek part.\nI needed a new mouse for my desk but didn’t want to buy the same mouse again only to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much that I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was somehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\n\nThen the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed $99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse. I received one for testing alongside the $99 Logitech’s MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great pair.\nMy favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and charge over USB-C (Apple’s mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same charger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\n\nThe MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX Master 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys wireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple’s standalone Magic Keyboard.\nThen there’s reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse and keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro and my iPad Pro, and switching between which device I’m using is as easy as a button press. Highly recommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro even further.\nBrydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\nApple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before the end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing board with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\nBrydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned keyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it’s not the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or Smart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in my house.\nMy wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her 12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age — even after a keyboard repair.\nNaturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for myself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio. iPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible for her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt to her.\n\nBrydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth, backlit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard case. I haven’t seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129, regular $149) since the day she got it.\nIt may not be for me, but it’s absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case among former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\nLooking for more gift recommendations?

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX said its Starship lunar lander will be able to transport 100 metric tons to the surface of the moon, far more than NASA's requirements under the CLPS program. Credit: SpaceX \n\n\nWASHINGTON — NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a contract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the moon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\nNASA said the five companies — Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems — had been selected to join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for the delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\nThis “on-ramp” to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the capability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission, a rover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south pole of the moon.\n“We were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need to accelerate that,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a teleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver tools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to delivering science payloads.\nThe largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its Starship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to 100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified amount back to Earth.\n“We do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS program,” said Shotwell, referring to NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services effort that funded the development of SpaceX’s commercial cargo capability.\nShotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such missions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a “nice stepping stone” to later crewed missions. She didn’t give a date for crewed missions, but said SpaceX would fly Starship “a lot” before flying any missions with people on board.\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems plans to leverage its experience in smallsats for its small lunar landers. Credit: Tyvak\nBlue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in May, capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. “It has a lot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large, open payload deck,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced development programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the lander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the specifics of each individual CLPS task order.\nNASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. “Our company is in a great position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because we build our own satellite systems,” said John Roth, vice president of business development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads leveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not disclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to start lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\nMichael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company’s CLPS award was a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA’s broader plans. “Space exploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire ecosystem of companies,” he said. “Small player being an agility and a creativity that adds to the mix.” He said his company’s lander should be available for missions starting in 2023.\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer. Marco Villa, the company’s chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage that experience in its lunar landers. “We’re going to start with something smaller,” he said. “Our flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead us to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.” He declined to say when his company’s lander would be ready.\nThe five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-ramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year ago: Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive Machines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond. In May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and OrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order two months later, citing internal business issues.\nClarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be released “sometime soon” for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for the VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for science instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two “deliveries” of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "articleBody": "Instagram began testing hiding public like counts globally on Thursday, after experimenting with the design tweak in several individual markets abroad. People who upload photos and videos will still know how many people liked them—that information just won’t be seen by other users. The experiment is part of a wider shift at social media companies, so far mostly a rhetorical one, away from the metrics it once told people had immense value. Like Instagram head Adam Mosseri, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has spoken out about the toxic consequences of overemphasizing statistics like follower and like counts. Twitter also released a beta version of its app earlier this year that puts less prominence on likes and retweets.But Instagram is one of the only major platforms to try bringing so-called demetrication to a wider segment of users. It’s previously tested removing likes in Italy, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Amid growing criticism of online platforms, abandoning likes allowed Mosseri to claim that Instagram wants to be “a space that feels much less pressurized.” But the Facebook-owned company has also quietly encouraged some users to embrace the anxiety and power that enhanced metrics can provide, by prompting them to convert their personal profiles into Instagram business accounts. Unsurprisingly, opening a business account is also a gateway to buying ads.Instagram first introduced business accounts in 2016. There are now 140 million monthly active “businesses” across Facebook’s various platforms, according to the company. Any user can convert their personal profile into a “business” or “creator” one at any time, both of which come with souped-up analytics capabilities. Many normal people, with no intention of making money from their Instagram presence, have opted-in to the feature. In the age of influencers, where the line between personal branding and personal life has all but disappeared, some people are naturally eager to run their Instagram profile like it’s a job—and Instagram is happy to help.Kym Lino, a spokesperson for Instagram, confirmed to WIRED that the company notifies people who it thinks could benefit from converting their personal accounts into business ones. “We use a machine learning model which predicts likely commercial intent of Instagram accounts to identify potential accounts that may benefit from professional tools like analytics,” they said in an email. It’s unclear what those signals might be, and Instagram declined to say.I changed my personal Instagram profile, which I started in 2013, into a professional one several weeks ago. Instagram allows you to choose what type of business you run, and I earnestly chose “Journalist.” I later found that many people, especially teens, opt for more ironic options like Cruise Line or Well Water Drilling Service. One friend has labeled herself a Grocery Store. After a few days, the statistics started rolling in. I could suddenly see things like how many people unfollowed me each week, how many visited my profile, and how many tapped on the people and places I tagged in my stories. It was eye-opening.I learned that over a dozen people tapped on the profile of a coworker after I tagged us eating Mexican food in my story. And I found out 46 people, for some reason or another, visited my profile in the last week—but only 16 had come from the one picture I uploaded. On that photo, of one of my oldest friends, I had written a long and gushing caption celebrating her birthday. My business account informed me that someone sent it to another person via direct message, but I couldn’t tell who or why. The analytics made salient the ways my friends and acquaintances surveil one another on Instagram all the time.“I was stunned just to see how many people visited my profile even without posting for several months,” said Joseph Minga, a friend who recently switched to a professional Instagram account. He learned around 75 to 100 people view his profile a week, out of around 1,500 followers. “It really made me take a step back and ask what are they looking for on here? and in all seriousness, could I have a cyberstalker?”Instagram also lets you see how people interact with your stories, including how many view them more than once, and the number who swipe away. “I was on vacation with my parents in France and posted it on my story. And like, of my 1,000 followers, five swiped away,” said Will Tjernlund, a consultant for Amazon sellers who has a business Instagram account. “It’s like wholesome content, that’s normal, and a cool image and background, and someone following me was like nah, not for me dog.”Even though Instagram’s professional analytics are extremely granular, they’re still anonymized, and can’t account for the reason why someone took a specific action. That makes it easy to agonize about what you don't know. “Since I have seen some of the extra data, I will question why I lost 14 followers in a week where I did not post anything at all. I don’t post as often anymore,” said Minga. “I think I have some sort of social media stage fright. Seeing that people were forwarding my posts to others via DM made me feel insecure.”Is there something you think we should know about Instagram? Email the writer at louise_matsakis@wired.com.

You can also mail us materials at 520 Third Street, Suite 350, San Francisco, CA 94107.In addition to behavior metrics, Instagram provides business accounts with a wealth of demographic data about their followers. That includes where they live, how old they are, whether they’re male of female (there’s no recognition of users who identify as nonbinary or transgender) and the times of day they’re active on the platform. It’s easy to see how this information would be useful to an influencer trying to boost engagement, or a brand who wants to know more about their audience. Instagram also attaches a large “Promote” button to every post, giving people the option to turn them into ads.As both NBC News and Bloomberg have reported, there’s a security risk associated with business Instagram accounts, which is particularly hazardous for minors. When people convert to business accounts, they often accidentally make their email address or phone number public. The feature is meant to make it easy for people to contact legitimate business entities, but kids with business accounts also end up revealing their personal information to the world.WIRED spoke to one mother, who knew her teenage daughter and son were masquerading as a Tax Preparation Service and a Go-Kart Track on Instagram, but didn’t realize their personal information might be on their profiles. “I am so ahead of every other parent of teens I know when it comes to technology,” she said. “I am literally facepalming that my 14-year-old son has a public Instagram account with his phone number on it.” Her daughter, on the other hand, had cleverly put down the number for Pizza Hut instead.“Businesses and creators are clearly informed in the sign-up or conversion flow that the contact information they would like to make public to help people contact them will be displayed,” Lino said. Last month, Instagram also made it possible for creator and business accounts to choose not to display their contact information.David Stier, a data scientist and business advisor in the Bay Area, has spent the last few months trying to track the global number of minors who may have professional Instagram accounts. He stumbled upon the issue while researching Instagram marketing for a potential client and became concerned. Because users can easily toggle between being corporations, “creators,” and normal people, Stier says he noticed the lines between all three groups on Instagram have blurred. “This thing is broken, like completely broken, in terms of a way of classifying and identifying what kind of an entity you are,” he says.Maybe Instagram likes it that way. After all, the platform has helped thousands of people monetize otherwise personal content about their lives. The boundaries between a money-making entity and a personal scrapbook are gone. Microinfluencers, and even nanoinfluencers (people with only a few thousand followers on Instagram at most), are now paid to hawk products like makeup and shampoo. Are these accounts actual businesses, in the traditional sense? Maybe not, but they often have access to the same analytics as one.More Great WIRED StoriesThe strange life and mysterious death of a virtuoso coderHow Facebook gets the First Amendment backwardThe enduring power of Asperger's, even as a non-diagnosisHow to opt out of the sites that sell your personal dataWhat Google's Fitbit buy means for the future of wearables👁 A safer way to protect your data; plus, check out the latest news on AI🏃🏽‍♀️ Want the best tools to get healthy?

        "articleBody": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)A muddled view of US-China trade talks once again seems to be weighing on investors. The major Asian market indexes were mixed in early trading Tuesday after CNBC reported that the mood in Beijing was pessimistic. The news organization, citing an anonymous government source, reported that President Donald Trump's reluctance to roll back tariffs was dampening China's outlook on trade talks.Japan's Nikkei 225 (N225) declined 0.3%, while South Korea's Kospi Index (KOSPI) fell 0.5%. China's Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) slumped 0.2%, but recovered those losses and was last trading up 0.4%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) started in the red, but was last trading up about 1%. Hong Kong stocks have been trying to claw back some losses after last week, when the index recorded its worst stretch since early August amid worsening protests in the city.\"With no significant data releases in Asia today, attention in the region will remain focused on trade concerns and Hong Kong,\" said Jeffrey Halley, a market analyst with the research firm Oanda, in a note. \"Neither is likely to inspire the confidence of market participants.\"US stock futures were last trading slightly positive during Asian trading hours after recording small losses earlier.A breakthrough in the US-China trade deal has remained just out of reach for quite some time. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have been expected to sign a partial trade deal for about a month, but those negotiations hit another snag last week.The US government on Monday did extend a temporary general license allowing American companies to sell to Huawei, the embattled Chinese tech company that has become a symbol of tensions between the two countries. It's the third 90-day extension of the license, which is now set to expire in February.\n"

        "articleBody": "November 20, 2019 - 11:28 AMTPanARMENIAN.Net - Verified video footage, eyewitness testimony from people on the ground and information gathered from human rights activists outside Iran reveal a harrowing pattern of unlawful killings by Iranian security forces, which have used excessive and lethal force to crush largely peaceful protests in more than 100 cities across Iran sparked by a hike in fuel prices on 15 November, said Amnesty International on Tuesday, November 19.  At least 106 protesters in 21 cities have been killed, according to credible reports received by Amnesty. The organization believes that the real death toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200 have been killed. State media have reported only a handful of protester deaths, as well as the deaths of at least four members of the security forces.  Video footage shows security forces using firearms, water cannons and tear gas to disperse protests and beating demonstrators with batons. Images of bullet casings left on the ground afterwards, as well as the resulting high death toll, indicate that they used live ammunition.  â€œThe authorities must end this brutal and deadly crackdown immediately and show respect for human life,â€� said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.  â€œThe frequency and persistence of lethal force used against peaceful protesters in these and previous mass protests, as well as the systematic impunity for security forces who kill protesters, raise serious fears that the intentional lethal use of firearms to crush protests has become a matter of state policy.â€�  Hundreds of demonstrators blocked roads, using their parked cars as a form of protest. Verified video footage shows riot police smashing windows of cars with drivers still inside.  According to eyewitness accounts corroborated by video footage, snipers have also shot into crowds of people from rooftops and, in one case, a helicopter.\n"

He had been facing the rape charge in Sweden since 2010.\n\nThe case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange because the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the Australian national remained in London.\n\nHowever, Swedish prosecutors decided to reopen the investigation in May after he was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London by the UK police and promptly taken into custody after Quito stripped him of his refugee status. That came seven years after he sought refuge at the mission to avoid extradition in an earlier Swedish investigation into the same rape case.\n\nFollowing Assange’s arrest in the UK, a lawyer for the woman involved in the case asked for the investigation to be resumed.\nThe journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related allegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out.\n\nAssange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in Britain for skipping bail.\n\nThe US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010.\n\nThe US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHe now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted of all the charges against him there.\n\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.     \n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n      Via SyndiGate.infoCopyright © 2019 Press TV.

Prior to launch Google promised players would be able to tap into powerful 10.7 teraflop hardware, allowing anybody to play games at 4k and 60fps on high settings, but the reality seems to be somewhat different.\nAccording to The Verge’s Stadia review, the streaming platform does not run its showcase launch title Destiny 2 in native 4K. Google confirmed this in a statement…\nWhen streaming at 4K, we render at a native 1080p and then upsample and apply a variety of techniques to increase the overall quality of effect.\nNot only is Destiny 2 not true 4K on Stadia, it runs at medium settings. So, in other words, Destiny 2 on Stadia is a marked step down from the Xbox One X version, which runs at native 4K with more visual pizazz. Apparently, Destiny 2 isn’t the only game not offering the visual quality Google promised – it's revealed in Eurogamer’s Stadia review that Red Dead Redemption 2 only renders at 1440p and 30fps with visual settings at around the same level seen on the Xbox One X. So, a little better than Destiny 2, but not the top-of-the-line experience we were told to expect. Presumably, other games also offer less-than-ideal visual performance.\nOf course, streaming games at 1080p/1440p with high-end console settings isn’t terrible. If you’re not a particularly techy person and just looking at Stadia as a replacement for consoles,  it’s not a bad alternative. That said, Google promised more, and for whatever reason, they’re not delivering yet. Hopefully they can work the kinks out and offer a true high-end experience soon.\nThe Google Stadia Founder’s and Premiere Editions, which come with a Chromecast Ultra, launch tomorrow (November 19) in 14 countries, including United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland. More traditional free-to-play and premium subscription options arrive in early 2020.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t     Share\n\t\t\t     Tweet\n\t\t\t     Submit\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n"

Credit: 20th Century Fox\n                    \n    If a sci-fi spaceship does not come with hyperdrive then it is usually fitted with hibernation capsules instead. In movies from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Event Horizon, Alien to Passengers, fictional astronauts get put into \"suspended animation\" to cross the vastness of space. Now ESA has investigated how real life crew hibernation would impact space mission design.\n                                                                                                                               Human hibernation has been the subject of initial research within the Discovery element of ESA's Basic Activities, then recommended as a key \"enabling technology\" for space by the Agency's Future Technology Advisory Panel, resulting in a dedicated \"Topical Team\" on hibernation.\nNow the Agency's SciSpacE team has called in ESA's Concurrent Design Facilityâ€”a multimedia facility enabling expert teams to perform initial evaluations of proposed future missionsâ€”to assess the advantages of human hibernation for a trip to a neighboring planet, such as Mars.\nBeginning with an assessment on the current state of the art in human hibernation, with the help of ESA Topical Team scientists from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the University of Goethe, Frankfurt, the CDF team went to investigate for the first time the potential impact of hibernation on system-level mission design. They took as their reference an existing mission study to send six humans to Mars and back in a five year timescale.\n\"We worked on adjusting the architecture of the spacecraft, its logistics, protection against radiation, power consumption and overall mission design,\" comments Robin Biesbroek of the CDF.\n\n        \n            \n             \n                A reference habitation module for a crewed Mars mission compared to its hibernation-based equivalent. Credit: ESA\n                    \n    \n\"We looked at how an astronaut team could be best put into hibernation, what to do in case of emergencies, how to handle human safety and even what impact hibernation would have on the psychology of the team. Finally we created an initial sketch of the habitat architecture and created a roadmap to achieve a validated approach to hibernate humans to Mars within 20 years.\"\nThe study found the spacecraft mass could be reduced by a third by removing the crew quarters with a similar reduction in consumables, equivalent to several tons of saved mass. Hibernation would take place in small individual pods that would double as cabins while the crew are awake.\nThe assumption was that a drug would be administered to induce \"torpor\"â€”the term for the hibernating state. Like hibernating animals, the astronauts would be expected to acquire extra body fat in advance of torpor. Their soft-shell pods would be darkened and their temperature greatly reduced to cool their occupants during their projected 180-day Earth-Mars cruise.\n                                                                                    \nThe hibernating cruise phase would end with a 21 day recuperation periodâ€”although based on the experience of animal hibernation, the expectation would be that the crew would not experience bone or muscle wastage.\n\n            \n            \n                \n                 \n                    Functional areas of the hibernation module: (1) private crew quarters, (2) exercise, (3) hygiene and waste, (4) dining and wardroom, (5) workstation, (6) galley and food, (7) medical supplies, (8) life support systems and stowage, (9) operational and maintenance supplies.Â In general, the habitat is divided into two zones of habitable volumes: the crew quarters which are used during the entire mission duration, and the volumes for wardroom and workstation, food preparation and eating, waste collection and hygiene, exercise, medical, operational and maintenance purposes that are only used during the time the crew is awake and active.

The soft-shelled pods would have individual thermal controls and flexible insulation, with a fan to circulate air and control humidity to prevent condensation when the temperature is reduced during hibernation. The pods would also be well shielded against radiation.Â (1) private crew quarters, (8) life support system and stowage, (10) circulation space. Credit: ESA\n                            \n        \n    \nRadiation exposure from high-energy particles is a key hazard of deep space travel, but because the hibernating crew will be spending so much time in their hibernation pods, then shieldingâ€”such as water containersâ€”could be concentrated around them. And existing research into hibernation shows it gives enhanced radiation protection in its own right.\nBut with all the crew incapacitated for extended periods of time, the mission would have to be designed for largely autonomous operations, with optimum use of artificial intelligence and \"fault detection, isolation and recovery\" to maintain a minimum level of system performance until the crew could be revived.\n\"For a while now hibernation has been proposed as a game-changing tool for human space travel,\" explains SciSpacE Team Leader Jennifer Ngo-Anh. \"If we were able to reduce an astronaut's basic metabolic rate by 75% â€“ similar to what we can observe in nature with large hibernating animals such as certain bearsâ€”we could end up with substantial mass and cost savings, making long-duration exploration missions more feasible.\n\"And the basic idea of putting astronauts into long-duration hibernation is actually not so crazy: a broadly comparable method has been tested and applied as therapy in critical care trauma patients and those due to undergo major surgeries for more than two decades. Most major medical centers have protocols for inducing hypothermia in patients to reduce their metabolism to basically gain time, keeping patients in a better shape than they otherwise would be.\n\"We aim to build on this in future, by researching the brain pathways that are activated or blocked during initiation of hibernation, starting with animals and proceeding to people.\"\n                                                                                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                        \n                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tG.

        "articleBody": "\n          With Hong Kong protests exploding to new levels, President Xi Jinping of China is likely to deploy Peoples Liberation Army forces onto the former British colony's streets. And that means a slaughter of some degree.\n          Xi's problem is simple. Hong Kong police and their Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence service masters are proving unable to stem the mass disorder. In so, painting a picture of political incompetence and security impotence, Hong Kong's street battles are an existential threat to Xi's regime. The protests degrade the Chinese Communist Party's claim to a divine right of power and weaken Xi's global narrative of a China that is destined to lead.\n          To be sure, Xi and his comrades on the powerful Standing Committee do not want to send the army into Hong Kong.\n          They know that doing so would spark immediate international furor and pressure otherwise China-sympathetic Western interests such as President Emmanuel Macron and the NBA to degrade their relationships with Beijing. Yet, neither can Xi allow this chaos to continue. Every day it does, the Communist Party appears weaker and thus more vulnerable to that which it most fears: resistance to its rule on the mainland and new international resistance to its global agenda.\n          And Beijing's current strategy for ending the protests is an obvious and manifest failure. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's recent trip to Beijing — a trip likely designed to avoid Western intelligence monitoring of communications — was about Beijing offering new guidance to end the violence. But Beijing's diktats to Lam have achieved nothing but chaos, agitating the protesters into new resistance. \n          Nor has Beijing's backtracking on the extradition law, which sparked the protests cooled protester fury. Propaganda efforts to persuade protesters to fall in love with the Communist Party have been similarly catastrophic. A recent face mask ban has also served the opposite effect and was ruled illegal by the Hong Kong court system on Monday. That decision by a relatively independent judiciary emphasizes the stakes in this great struggle between authoritarian aggression and the democratic rule of law.\n          At the same time, however, those who believe Xi's Communist Party is stuck are deluding themselves. \n          Unlike us in the West, the Standing Committee views its mission to usurp the American-led liberal international order through the prism of generations, not years. Nor does Xi see Hong Kong struggle through a simple microcosm of individual rights versus central power. He sees it as a great test for his Chinese dream. Forced to choose between a military crackdown, which sparks a year or two of international fury, and Hong Kong's collapse into anarchy, Xi will choose the former.\n          In short, slaughter is likely coming to Hong Kong.\n         \n"

        "articleBody": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is considered the most common feeding and eating disorder in the United States (1). BED is about more than food, itâ€™s a recognized psychological condition. That means people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a medical professional to overcome it.People who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually large amounts, even when theyâ€™re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a strong sense of guilt or shame. Regular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health conditions like diabetes and heart disease.Fortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try â€” both at home and with the help of a professional â€” to reduce episodes of binge eating.Here are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.1. Ditch the dietFad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly restrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.For example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was associated with a higher risk of binge eating (2).Similarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain foods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (3).Instead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or significantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making healthy changes.Eat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from your diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better health.Summary Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods completely.2. Avoid skipping mealsSetting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most effective ways to overcome binge eating.Skipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.One small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased levels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater extent than eating three meals per day (4).Another study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was associated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).Try setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.Summary Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting blood sugar.3. Practice mindfulnessMindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying attention to how you feel at the moment.This technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize when they no longer feel hungry.One review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation decreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (6).Another small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (7).Try listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally, try to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.Summary Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when youâ€™re no longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the incidence of binge eating.4. Stay hydratedDrinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to curb cravings and stop overeating.In fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to decreased hunger and calorie intake.For example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13%, compared with a control group (8).Similarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13â€“17 ounces (375â€“500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (9).Other studies indicate that drinking more water can boost metabolism and weight loss (10, 11).The amount of water each person should drink daily depends on various factors. Thus, itâ€™s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty to ensure youâ€™re staying well hydrated.Summary Drinking more water can keep you feeling full to decrease calorie intake and prevent binge eating.5. Try yogaYoga is a practice that incorporates both the body and mind by using specific breathing exercises, poses, and meditation to reduce stress and enhance relaxation.Studies indicate that yoga can help encourage healthy eating habits and reduce the risk of emotional eating.One small study in 50 people with BED showed that practicing yoga for 12 weeks led to a significant reduction in binging (12).Another study in 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating disorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and body image disturbances â€” all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating (13).Research also shows that yoga can decrease levels of stress hormones like cortisol to keep stress under control and prevent binge eating (14, 15).Try joining a local yoga studio to start adding this type of exercise to your routine. You can also use online resources and videos to practice at home.Summary Yoga can help prevent binge eating and may reduce common triggers like stress, depression, and anxiety.6. Eat more fiberFiber moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full longer (16).Some research suggests that increasing fiber intake could cut cravings, reduce appetite, and food intake.One small, 2-week study found that supplementing twice daily with a type of fiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing fullness (17).Another study in 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of prebiotic fiber daily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and significantly reduced feelings of hunger (18).Fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few fiber-rich foods that can keep you feeling full.Summary Fiber can help keep you feeling full to reduce calorie intake and feelings of hunger.7. Clean out the kitchenHaving lots of junk food or trigger foods in the kitchen can make it much easier to binge eat.Conversely, keeping healthy foods on hand can reduce your risk of emotional eating by limiting the number of unhealthy options.Start by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-packaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives.Stocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole grains, nuts, and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of binge eating unhealthy foods.Summary Removing unhealthy foods from your kitchen and stocking up on healthy alternatives can improve diet quality and make it harder to binge eat.8. Start hitting the gymStudies indicate that adding exercise to your routine could prevent binge eating.For instance, one 6-month study in 77 people showed that increasing weekly exercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants (19).Another study in 84 women found that pairing cognitive behavioral therapy with regular exercise was significantly more effective at reducing the frequency of binge eating than therapy alone (20).Plus, other research suggests that exercise can decrease stress levels and enhance mood to prevent emotional eating (21).Walking, running, swimming, biking, and playing sports are just a few different forms of physical activity that can help relieve stress and reduce binge eating.Summary Studies show that exercising can reduce the risk of binge eating and decrease stress levels.9. Eat breakfast every dayStarting each day off with a healthy breakfast might reduce the risk of binge eating later in the day.Several studies have found that maintaining a regular eating pattern is associated with less binge eating and lower levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates feelings of hunger (4, 5).Plus, filling up on the right foods can keep you feeling full to curb cravings and reduce hunger throughout the day.For example, one study in 15 people found that eating a high-protein breakfast reduced levels of ghrelin to a greater extent than eating a high carb breakfast (22).Meanwhile, eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal was shown to improve appetite control and promote fullness in another study in 48 people (23).Try combining a few fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole grains, with a good source of protein to avoid overeating.Summary Eating a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast can prevent cravings and keep you satisfied throughout the morning.10. Get enough sleepSleep affects your hunger levels and appetite, and sleep deprivation may be linked to binge eating.In fact, one study in 146 people found that those with BED reported significantly more symptoms of insomnia than people without a history of this condition (24).Another large study showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with higher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of leptin â€” the hormone responsible for promoting fullness.Additionally, sleeping less than 8 hours per night was linked to higher body weight (25).Aim to squeeze in at least 8 hours per night to keep your appetite in check and reduce your risk of binge eating.Summary BED may be linked to increased symptoms of insomnia. Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter the levels of hormones that affect hunger and appetite.11. Keep a food and mood journalKeeping a food and mood journal that tracks what you eat and how you feel can be an effective tool. It can help identify potential emotional and food triggers and promote healthier eating habits.One study in 17 people showed that using an online self-help program that involved keeping a food diary was associated with fewer self-reported episodes of binge eating (26).Several other studies also suggest that tracking your intake may be linked to increased weight loss and aid long-term weight management (27, 28, 29).To get started, simply start recording what you eat and how you feel each day using either a journal or app.Summary Food and mood journals can help identify triggers to address potential problems. Studies show that using a food diary is associated with fewer episodes of binge eating, as well as increased weight loss.12. Find someone to talk toTalking to a friend or peer when you feel like binging may help reduce your likelihood of overeating.One study in 101 adolescents undergoing sleeve gastrectomy showed that reliable social support was associated with less binge eating (30).Another study in 125 women with obesity found that better social support was linked to decreased binge eating severity (31).A good social support system is thought to reduce the impact of stress, which may help decrease your risk of other coping habits like emotional eating (32, 33).Next time you feel like binge eating, pick up the phone and call a trusted friend or family member. If you donâ€™t have someone to talk to, eating disorder helplines are available free of charge.Summary A good social support system may be linked to decreased binge eating and stress.13. Increase your protein intakeUpping your intake of protein-rich foods can keep you feeling full and help control your appetite.One study in 19 people showed that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% led to significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, as well as decreased daily calorie intake by an average of 441 calories (34).Similarly, another study found that following a high-protein diet enhanced metabolism, promoted feelings of fullness, and increased levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone known for its ability to suppress appetite (35).Try including at least one good source of protein â€” such as meat, eggs, nuts, seeds, or legumes â€” in each meal and enjoy high-protein snacks when you feel hungry to keep cravings at bay.Summary Increasing your protein intake has been shown to decrease calorie intake, enhance feelings of fullness, and increase levels of GLP-1, a hormone that can help suppress appetite.14. Plan mealsPlanning meals can help ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand to prepare nutritious meals. Also, measuring out portion sizes and putting the remainder of food away may help you avoid triggering a binge. In fact, one study in over 40,000 adults showed that meal planning was associated with improvements in diet quality and variety, as well as a lower risk of obesity (36).Meal planning also makes it easier to stick to a regular eating pattern, which has been linked to a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).Set aside an hour or two each week to plan out a weekly rotation for your meals.Summary Meal planning has been associated with improvements in diet quality and variety. It can also make sticking to a regular eating pattern easier and ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand at all times.15. Seek help While the strategies above can be helpful, oftentimes a treatment plan designed by a professional is needed to help overcome binging.Treatment for BED can involve different types of therapy or medications to help get binging under control and treat any underlying causes or symptoms.Cognitive behavioral therapy, the most effective form of therapy, explores the connection between your thoughts, feelings, and eating patterns and then develops strategies to modify your behavior (37).Other types of therapy used to treat binge eating include dialectical behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral weight loss therapy (37).Antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and certain stimulants are also sometimes used to treat BED, though more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of these medications (38, 39).Summary Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered an effective treatment method for binge eating. Other types of therapy and certain medications can also be used.The bottom lineBED is a recognized psychological condition that affects millions of people around the world. However, itâ€™s possible to overcome it with the right treatment plan and healthy lifestyle modifications. \n"

        "articleBody": "Nov. 20, 2019 6:02 AM ESTLONDON (AP) — Britain's Conservative Party was accused Wednesday of trying to deceive voters by changing the name of its press office Twitter account to “factcheckUK” during a televised election debate between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.  \nRebranded to resemble a neutral fact-checking account, it posted a series of tweets supporting Johnson during Tuesday’s debate. It later reverted to the name “CCHQ Press” and restored the party logo to its profile.Organizations that seek to combat political misinformation cried foul.“It was an attempt to mislead voters,’’ Will Moy, chief executive of the London-based fact-checking website Full Fact, told the BBC. “And I think it is inappropriate and misleading for a serious political party to behave that way.”Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the party’s actions, saying the Twitter account was clearly linked to the Conservatives.“We make no apology for having an instant rebuttal to all the nonsense and lies put out,” Raab told the BBC.Twitter pledged to take “decisive corrective action” against similar strategies in the future. But the manipulation of the account in a high-profile event put the issue of the rise of digital campaigning squarely in the public eye.All political parties are devoting much of their campaign spending to the digital realm as they battle to win the U.K.’s Dec. 12 election.Despite parliamentary reports urging new regulations to combat misinformation or regulate the way digital ads are targeted at voters, officials in Britain have made no significant changes to laws governing online ads, social media and election disinformation.In a reflection of the confusion, the Electoral Commission, which regulates campaign finances, issued a statement warning that “voters are entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners in the lead-up to an election.’’ Critically, however, it pointed out that it doesn’t have “a role in regulating election campaign content.’’With the absence of law, campaigns have already been pressing the boundaries to get attention. The Conservative Party became embroiled in controversy earlier this month when it posted a video on social media containing a misleading edit of a television interview with Keir Starmer, a senior Labour Party figure. The video had been altered to show Starmer failing to answer a question about Brexit, when, in fact, he responded quickly. The chairman of the Conservative Party described the doctored video as lighthearted satire.In their first TV debate of the election on Tuesday, Johnson and Corbyn attacked each other’s policies on Brexit, health care and the economy.But the debate likely failed to answer the question that has dogged the campaign: Who can voters trust? The two leaders sidestepped tricky questions about their own policies in the hourlong encounter and drew derisive laughter from the studio audience at several points.Both Johnson and Corbyn are trying to overcome a mountain of mistrust as they try to win over a Brexit-weary electorate.Johnson is under fire for failing to deliver on his often-repeated vow that Britain would leave the EU on Oct. 31.Audience members laughed when he urged voters, “Look what I have said I’m going to do as a politician and look what I’ve delivered.”Corbyn, a stolid socialist, is accused by critics of promoting high-tax policies and of failing to clamp down on anti-Semitism within his party. His refusal to say which side he would be on in a Brexit referendum was also met with hoots of laughter.Televised debates are a relatively new phenomenon in British elections — the first took place in 2010 — and they have the power to transform campaigns. A confident 2010 appearance by former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg sparked a wave of “Cleggmania” that helped to propel him into the deputy prime minister post in a coalition government with the Conservatives. Clegg now works for Facebook.___Follow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n              \n    Trending\n    \n                    'Tarzan' actor Ron Ely's wife killed; son shot by deputies \n                                      Iowa man finds 5 inches of animal blood flooding basement \n                              Airline went into records after Max crash, engineer says \n                              \n      \n"

The patients, a husband and wife, are from Inner Mongolia, an autonomous and sparsely populated region in the northern part of the country. They were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, one of the two main forms of infection caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestisâ€”the other being bubonic plague, which can advance to pneumonic plague if the infection spreads to the lungs. Yersinia pestis, per the WHO, is often found in small mammals and their fleas.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Pneumonic plague is the most deadly form of the disease. It is highly contagious, spreading from person to person via infected respiratory droplets. Without medical intervention, the disease is inevitably fatal. But recovery rates are high if it is detected and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  The ailing couple was quarantined, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said it had conducted epidemiological investigations on people who might have been exposed to the patients, according to Sui-Lee Wee of the New York Times. All â€œrelevant sitesâ€� were also disinfected, reports Wee. The CDC assured the public on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media site, that the risks of transmission were â€œextremely low.â€�\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  On November 16, a third case of plague was reported in a 55-year-old man, also from Inner Mongolia. He had, according to Alex Horton of the Washington Post, killed and eaten a wild rabbit before he was taken to a hospital around 185 miles northwest of Beijing. The man was diagnosed with bubonic plague.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  The Associated Press reports that 28 people who came into contact with the patient were quarantined, and displayed no symptoms of plagueâ€”like the sudden onset of fever, body aches, vomiting and nausea. As yet, there is no epidemiological evidence linking the third plague case to the earlier two, the Inner Mongolia health commission said, according to Reuters.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Over the centuries, plague has killed millions of people around the world, most famously during the Black Death, which wiped out nearly one-third of Europeâ€™s population in the 1300s. Yersinia pestis is believed to have originated in China, spreading to the West via ships. Today, plague infections are rare, but they do happen. According to WHO, there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, with 584 deaths. China has experienced a small smattering of plague infections in recent yearsâ€”26 cases and 11 deaths between 2009 and 2018, reports Reuters. \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Though the government has attempted to reassure the Chinese public in the wake of the recent diagnoses, many have voiced concerns that officials are minimizing or even restricting information about the cases.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  The first two illnesses were confirmed on November 12. But according to NPRâ€™s Feng, Li Jifeng, a doctor at Chaoyang Hospital where the patients were treated, wrote in a blog post that the couple had been transported to the facility on November 3â€”nine days before an announcement was made, raising questions about the reason for the delay.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Li explained that plague cases need to be carefully investigated and verified, and announcements about them cannot be â€œtransmitted casually.â€� But her post was still taken down by censors. Wee of the Times reports that censors had also instructed digital news aggregators to â€œblock and controlâ€� discussions pertaining the news about the plague.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  â€œDon't hide things like this,â€� one Weibo commenter said, per Feng. â€œLetâ€™s face whatever it is together.â€�\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Current fears about a potential plague outbreak are perhaps being fuelled by Chinaâ€™s handling of past health crises. In 2003, authorities there were accused of concealing the true extent of the countryâ€™s SARS outbreakâ€”and Beijing officials ultimately admitted that the city had experienced 10 times as many cases as they had initially reported.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  In the wake of that outbreak, China â€œvastly improved its detection and management of infectious diseases,â€� writes the Associated Press. And though the Chinese CDC has said that there is â€œno needâ€� for Beijing residents to worry about the risk of plague infection, it has also acknowledged that remote regions of the countryâ€”like Yunnan and the Qinghai-Tibet plateauâ€”are vulnerable to outbreaks. Officials have warned people to stay away from infected areas, and to avoid contact with rodents.\n\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n"

He hasn't taken part in these negotiations.\"In the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record label, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 – who reps the likes of Justin Beiber, Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande – has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29, however the “Bad Blood” songstress allegedly hasn’t been returning Braun’s calls, the source further claimed to the outlet.TAYLOR SWIFT CLEARED TO PERFORM HITS AT AMAs AMID FEUD WITH SCOOTER BRAUN, BIG MACHINE RECORDS: REPORT\n      Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta pose for a photo at a private residence on June 28, 2019 in Montecito, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Ithaca Holdings)\n      \"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider added of the continuing spat.On Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it possible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards after Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned company of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own the master recordings, at the AMAsA LONG, DRAWN OUT HISTORY OF TAYLOR SWIFT'S FEUDSThe statement, which was obtained by Variety, claimed that Big Machine and Dick Clark Productions had “come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platform.” The agreement maintained that it would not only cover Swift’s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed,” the statement continued.However, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to an agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that it had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\n      Braun’s Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group, home to Swift’s first six albums, including the Grammy winners for album of the year, 2008’s “Fearless” and 2014’s “1989.” (Photos by Richard Shotwell, left, and Mark Von Holden/Invision/AP)\n      “At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the production company said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone. “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”On Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big Machine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has been working on where her music was to be used. The company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its website.TAYLOR SWIFT'S FORMER LABEL BOSS BLASTS HER SCOOTER BRAUN 'BULLYING' CLAIMS, SAYS SHE KNEW ABOUT SALE\"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her tumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read. \"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.\"\"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward. \"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,\" the statement concluded.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSwift's rep told Fox News that this, too, was not the whole truth. \"Big Machine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them but, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes Taylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"A rep for Braun did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.Fox News’ Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.\n"

        "articleBody": "\n\t\tIf youâ€™re like me and you donâ€™t follow football throughout the season, you can always find something to love about game day â€” whether itâ€™s rooting for the underdog, enjoying the halftime show and the commercials, or just having a good time with friends and family.\nAs co-creator of the weight-loss programÂ 2B Mindset,Â I want to help you enjoy everything about game day, including those delicious snacks!\nFootball food is â€œcomfort foodâ€� â€” pizza, wings, chips, dips, and subs â€” and they can be very hard to resist.\nBut itâ€™s important to remember that weâ€™re fueling our bodies to watch football, not actually play it!\n5 Tips to Enjoy Game Day Parties While Staying on Track With Your Weight-Loss Goals:\n1. Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\nI know â€” it all looks so good. But you canâ€™t eat it all, so itâ€™s time to set priorities.\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks â€” those that are vegetable based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so youâ€™re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\nAnd you donâ€™t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just canâ€™t live without and leave it at that.\n2. Donâ€™t forget to drink water\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if youâ€™re drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because theyâ€™re there.\n3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when weâ€™re feeling especially hungry.\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\nThatâ€™s especially true when we are watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there â€” and without realizing it, weâ€™ve consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying our food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much youâ€™re eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you donâ€™t overdo it.\nKeep your eyes on the prize and donâ€™t let your fingers do the walking.\n\n4. â€œVeggie-fyâ€� your chips â€˜nâ€™ dip\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip. But instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a veggie instead.\nBecause letâ€™s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that itâ€™s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and youâ€™ll see that youâ€™ll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\nAnd donâ€™t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip â€” those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\nHealthy Game Day Dip: \nMix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories. Enjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and youâ€™ll get plenty of tangy crunch â€” without all the calories.\n5. Go topless (with your sub)\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, youâ€™re saving nearly 100 calories â€” about the same as a bottle of light beer.\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats? This is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself â€œno.â€� Thatâ€™s why I always tell my clients: â€œan open face is a happy face!â€�\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether youâ€™re out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks â€” without overdoing it!\nGet started withÂ 2B Mindset here.\n\nÂ \n\t\n"

I’m about to show you how to become an online business leader naturally and with less stress and fear.How a success mindset helps you triumph onlineThis is the second article in a series about how to build an online business you’ll love.In the first article, I talked about how online businesses are built in predictable stages.I shared a quiz that helps you pinpoint the stage you’re in now.The BIG benefit of knowing your business-building stage?It allows you to focus all your efforts on reaching the important milestones in that stage … and gives you permission to ignore the stages you’re not in right now.Say goodbye to that feeling of overwhelm you’ve been carrying around!Take a look if you haven’t read it yet: Why Some People Triumph Online and Others Never Make ItToday, I’m going to build on what I shared in the first article by showing you how to shift your “success mindset” toward growth. I’m going to map out an easy path to becoming the online leader your business needs.I don’t see anyone else online talking about this, so today I’m breaking the silence!I think you’ll like what you’re about to learn. There’s a way to do this that’s not stressful and that builds naturally from one experience to another.My goal with this article is to show you a way to become more comfortable standing both behind and in front of the online business you’re building. Ready?Have you experienced these “moments of personal growth?”Any time you’re building a business — online or offline — you’re going to experience some moments that cause you to … well, let’s say they cause you to grow as a person.That’s putting a pleasant spin on it, isn’t it?Maybe you’ve experienced these moments before:You’re putting together a first offer and then it hits you — “Oh, if I want people to buy this, I have to market it … not just now, but forever!”You know that in order to reach prospects you’ve got to extend yourself. But yikes … outreach is so uncomfortable!You’re given opportunities to be more visible — maybe it’s an interview request or a small speaking gig — and you’re terrified to say “yes.”If you’ve experienced any of these challenging moments, guess what? You’re normal! And they help to form your success mindset.But if you stay stuck in these moments and don’t move beyond them, your business won’t become what it can be.Your introverted side will stay cozy and comfortable, that’s for sure.But you will always wonder, “What would have happened if I’d experienced the momentary discomfort and pushed past it?”That’s what we’re going to cover here: a way to embrace a success mindset and push beyond the momentary discomfort so you can experience everything that’s waiting for you on the other side.Beware the deep endBefore we dive in, let’s talk about the deep end for a moment.There are a lot of people online who are pushing their solutions for gaining visibility in your online business. They’re selling:Courses on writing a bookWorkshops on becoming a highly paid speakerClasses on running successful webinarsThese are all good things. They’re all things I’ve done myself! But if you take courses on doing these “deep end” things before you’ve done some of the “shallow end” things I’m about to share, you may end up feeling intimidated — not inspired.And sadly, you may never take the first steps.That’s what I’m about to cover … the first steps. They’re crucial!Read on for three tips that will help you build a firm foundation for online leadership so that courses like the ones above feel like a natural next step.1. Start small and recognize that no one is watchingHere’s an analogy:When you’re in the planning and in the early building stages of your online businesses — planning your website and offers, and building the first-draft versions of both — there’s a helpful way to think about what you’re doing.Imagine you’re in an auditorium in the backstage area, and the curtains are drawn. No one in the audience can see what you’re doing back there!You’re planning and building what you’ll reveal to the world — but you haven’t pulled back the curtains and invited them in.Here’s what I want you to remember …When you do finally pull back those curtains with your heart in your throat and sweat beading on your upper lip?No one is watching.I mean, if you’re lucky a few family members and friends are in your audience in the early days. But for the most part? There’s almost no one there.It’s the perfect time to explore making yourself more visible. With fewer people watching your first visibility attempts, you won’t feel as intimidated by the process.So start small and experiment! More on ways to experiment in the next section …2. Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1A few years ago, I was honored to be asked to speak twice at Darren Rowse’s Problogger conference in Australia. The topic of one of my presentations was creating online “events” that build your audience.In that presentation I talked about how the online world gives you many opportunities to step out of your comfort zone.And I used this highly scientific graphic to illustrate the idea:It got a good laugh! And I made my point, which is …It’s smart to start with less-intimidating things and work your way up to the more intimidating things.Increasing your visibility gradually lets you grow into your online leadership role with much less stress.Click To TweetEveryone’s list will be different. For me, the online visibility spectrum used to look like this:NOT SCARYWriting a blog postWriting a piece of email marketingSpeaking to someone on the phoneKIND OF SCARYPublishing the blog postSending the piece of email marketingSpeaking to someone on a video callINTIMIDATINGParticipating in a podcast interviewSpeaking as a member of a panelPresenting a live webinarTERROR LEVEL 100Delivering the keynote speech at a conferenceHosting a live video on a social media platformPublishing and promoting a bookHere’s the thing:I didn’t go from the Non-scary stuff to the Terror Level 100 list.Instead, I moved from the Non-scary to the Kind of Scary stuff. I mastered the Kind of Scary list and moved on to the Intimidating list. I got comfortable with the Intimidating list and found myself ready to tackle the Terror Level 100 list.All the while, my visibility increased. My success mindset became more resilient.As you push into your next level of discomfort, you’ll find yourself being asked to participate in highly visible online events. People will ask you to write blog posts for them; appear on their podcasts; deliver the keynote addresses at their conferences.The good news?You’ll have a strong success mindset and you’ll be ready for it all.3. Get support for the scary stuff to strengthen your success mindsetWe already talked about how introverts can thrive online.We sit alone at our screens, crafting information and messages that reach across the world and draw an audience to us … without having to leave the comfort of our homes, if we don’t want to.But sitting in comfort stops you from growing into an online leadership role that will benefit you and your business.When it comes to moving yourself along the “visibility spectrum” toward a leadership role, it’s incredibly helpful to have a group of supportive colleagues by your side. People who share your dreams; empathize with your frustrations; and are generous with their support.I can’t tell you how many times I’ve reached out to colleagues and said something along the lines of …“Argh! I know I need to do this but it’s scary!”Having a team of people around you that you can be “real” with is vital if you want to move yourself along that visibility spectrum.I’m very happy to say that a I’m building that team of people for you right now.If you’d like to find out more about the BIG League — my community for online business builders — download the Online Business Success Roadmap. It’s the approach we follow in the program.Here’s how to switch up your success mindset and become the online leader your business needsLet’s quickly recap what we covered in this article:Start small and recognize that no one is watching.

Take it step-by-step and get support for the hard parts and you’ll get there before you know it.Share this information, please?A favor: would you take a moment to share this information?As I said earlier, I don’t see anyone else talking about how building up to an online leadership role will grow your business — and how to do it with less stress.I’d really love to get this information out to more people, so if you can take a moment to share, I’d appreciate it.Coming next: how to make Plan & Grow BIG work for your businessIn the final article in this series, we’re going to dig deep into how the Plan & Grow BIG approach to building an online business really works — and how to put it to use in your business.It’s all about finding your starting point and focusing on the milestones that are just ahead.If you’re just starting out, I’ll show you the path to take to get your online business off to a great start.If you’ve already built your online business but it hasn’t reached its full potential, you’ll discover some new ideas for skyrocketing your growth.Go forth and leadNow you know a natural progression you can use to step into an online leadership role that will grow your reach and your revenues. \n"

        "articleBody": " (CNN)President Donald Trump, according to the White House, made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed hospital on Saturday for a \"quick exam and labs\" as the first stage of his annual physical.You shouldn't just believe them.Which is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe even routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House who have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including the President's health -- that should force any rational person to question the explanation currently being offered by the White House.Remember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his most recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243 pounds. In his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a common form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant that the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5 years, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic.)At the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.Now consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.So, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the past.In December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein. \"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"If it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had! Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"So, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.(Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's health an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen feeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)Given that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White House is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"Which is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren't.This -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should you.\n"

In fact, scientists believe that thereâ€™s a liquid water ocean on Europa beneath a miles-thick ice shell that has twice as much water as all of the oceans on Earth.

Finding water vapor on Europa, he said, is the â€œnext best thingâ€� to liquid water.

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff speaks during a media briefing after a House vote approving rules for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, October 31, 2019. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTime is not on Adam Schiff’s side.Adam Schiff’s impeachment inquiry is incoherent. Given the impossibility of a senatorial conviction, the only strategy is to taint the president with the brand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election.\nYet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned. Far from tormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza, Trump’s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce, the better the optics. Polls show that Trump is almost back to where he was in popularity when Schiff unleashed his late-September Ukrainian caper. And the point, after all, was again to drive down Trump’s popularity and render him politically inert.\n\n\nFrom the day Schiff reemerged after his licking his wounds in hibernation, following the Mueller implosion, his efforts have insidiously gone downhill. Once Trump released the transcript of his July 25th call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, the nation learned that the Schiff’s gold-standard whistleblower was no such thing. Instead, he seems a rank partisan and sloppy leaker whose machinations and background are already boomeranging back on those who put him up to this present circus.\nSchiff never expected that Trump would release a classified transcript of his own presidential call — Democrats expected secrecy and coverup, much as the deep-state intelligence-agency miscreants acted unethically and illegally on the presumption that Hillary Clinton would be easily elected and their dishonest efforts would be rewarded and kept quiet.\n\nOne of the strangest developments of the opening inquiry was Schiff’s own doubling-down admission that he didn’t know the name of the whistleblower. After previously lying that neither he nor his staff had contact with the whistleblower (“We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower”) — he now ups the ante, apparently assuming that neither his staff nor the whistleblower will testify under oath.\n\n\nSchiff’s astounding assertion that he doesn’t know the whistleblower’s name is as hard to believe as Robert Mueller’s own congressional testimony that he was not familiar with Fusion GPS — the font of the entire Steele dossier that itself fueled the collusion fantasy that led to Mueller’s own appointment.\nUnlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings, Schiff has no special prosecutor’s finding of felonious presidential behavior. Instead, he has a veritable exoneration from the failure of the ill-starred special counsel to find either collusion or actionable obstruction of such a non-crime.\n\nMueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and related matters in the 2016 election. Twenty-two months, over 20 lawyers and investigators and $35 million later, Mueller folded his tent without criminal referrals or findings of presidential crimes, and then he more or less embarrassed the entire investigation in an enfeebled, deer-in-the-headlights congressional testimony.\n\nAt this point, the country would not put up with yet another special prosecutor entrusted to investigate “Ukrainian collusion.” They would know the post-Mueller drill in advance: A Washington “wise man” icon would follow the Mueller script of finding no such crime, while ignoring quite considerable crimes, with the Bidens now playing the role of Hillary Clinton’s bought-and-paid-for Christopher Steele.\nMost of Schiff’s witnesses in this inquiry were incoherent in the same critical sense: They never cite knowledge of presidential crimes but feel that Trump is dangerous, given their own disagreements with his supposedly reckless policy. And their chagrin in the end boils down to their empty charges that Trump is appeasing Russia at the expense of the Kurds and Ukraine. Apparently their supposedly superior ancestries, pedigrees, and education should supersede the foreign-policy prerogatives of the president of the United States.\n\nYet our shocked State Department experts somehow cannot explain why they were abjectly silent during the Obama administration when the “reset” proved to be virtual appeasement of Vladimir Putin; when Obama on a hot mic both offered the Russians a disturbing quid pro quo and then followed through on it; when Obama declined to send arms to Ukraine; and when Vice President Joe Biden took over as point man for Ukrainian policy only to leverage U.S. aid in exchange for Ukraine’s ceasing investigations of corruption that eventually would have targeted his own morally compromised son.\nAnd why would these career experts be outraged by the Trump administration that at last fulfilled their wildest agendas: ending the reset, upping sanctions against Russians, killing hired Russian thugs in Syria, pulling out of the warped missile agreement with Russia, increasing American and NATO defense expenditures, pumping more oil to lower world prices to the detriment of Russia, and arming Ukraine?\n\nWhat would have been the reaction in 2012 had an anonymous Bush holdover at the Obama National Security Council gone to the IG — but only after first consulting secretly with the staff of Devin Nunes — to claim third-hand knowledge of a confidential Obama phone call to Russia’s President Medvedev? The Bush-era whistleblower, a protégé of John Bolton and Dick Cheney, would then have claimed that he was told by an anonymous NSC leaker that Obama in the call had confirmed his prior hot-mic, quid pro quo promise to drop missile defense in Eastern Europe if Putin would in return give “space” to Obama before the 2012 election — with “space” perhaps defined as the Russians keeping quiet and making Obama’s foreign policy seem successful in the run-up to Election Day. Would there have been impeachment proceedings against Obama? Would Adam Schiff have pleaded to keep the “whistleblower’s” identity secret?\n\nMost significantly, Schiff is now working against the clock.\n\nEach day closer to the November 2020 election is one day nearer to allowing the American people to vote on their first-team president. There is no Nixonian or Clintonian argument that without impeachment, a second-term president could not be brought to heel. Schiff has essentially decided to abort the early 2020 campaign and substitute in its place his star-chamber impeachment.\nDay-by-day Schiff’s ginned-up media hysteria has created a virtual news blackout of the Democratic presidential front-runners. We are well into the 2020 campaign and the public knows almost nothing about these would-be presidents other than that in toto they are a strange bunch. The media-starved peripheral candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker will go the way of the suffocated Beto O’Rourke until someone or something yanks Schiff offstage.\nEach day that is wasted is another day that the new House majority did not, as it promised, address substantive issues. Since January 2018, it has not talked of infrastructure, recalibrated trade deals, budgetary compromises, drug prescription pricing, or anything else other than one iteration after another of attacking Trump. Certainly, if they really believed that Trump was an incompetent buffoon, the better strategy would have been to step aside, let him ruin the economy, and then run in 2020 against his incompetence.\nIronically, the longer Trump survives, the more likely he’ll grow stronger and dominate the news at the expense of the progressive front-runners. To get attention back from Schiff, the front-runners must become even shriller and crazier — from Bernie Sanders’s declaring an end to all deportations to Elizabeth Warren’s dreaming up an unhinged multi-trillion-dollar wealth tax to pay for “Medicare for all.” What will happen when these barnstorming senators are trapped in an impeachment farce in the Senate?\nSchiff also knows that voters have an upcoming rendezvous with the reports of Michael Horowitz and John Durham. If sane, Schiff should hurry up; otherwise James Comey or Andrew McCabe might be indicted and smother his narrative. Horowitz is likely to have more criminal referrals, and Durham might well proceed with indictments — at precisely the time that Schiff is lecturing the nation that its president is a criminal who mysteriously was exonerated by a special counsel.\nSchiff is also risking Trump exhaustion — the magical point at which the public tires of the serial psychodramas of the voting-machine ruse, the Electoral College–subversion gambit, removal of Trump by the 25th Amendment, the Logan Act, the emoluments clause, Mueller, Stormy, Cohen, the tax returns, recession, and now Ukraine — seasoned with 90 percent negative media coverage and celebrity outbursts about blowing up, decapitating, or incinerating Trump. In other words, the more Schiff pushes these serial whines, the closer he gets to Election Day, and the more the people shrug and think, “Enough already, just vote.”\nVoters are also human. Schiff believes that the more chaos he creates, the more the collective public will fall into a fetal position, cover its ears, and scream, “Make Trump just go away.” But the opposite is more likely: At some point people sympathize not with the stoners of the declared public enemy, but with the stoned target who is ripped and bloodied by the mob. In the final scene from Braveheart, the once-hated Scottish hero William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is stretched, drawn and quartered, and variously tortured before an English crowd\nthat’s hissing and calling for more blood — up until a point.\n\nOnce the kings’ torturers exhaust their repertoire of savagery, even the anti-Scottish crowd gets repelled and begins yelling “Mercy!”\nSo too, with Trump. After the Dems decided to wage a three-year-long presidential abortion, and attacked Trump’s wife, children, family, businesses, and associates, 24/7, the public has begun finally to wonder at what point enough is enough. People will begin to think the target of unhinged vituperation must be doing something right to warrant such unattractive enemies, and that he is therefore worthy of empathy.\nIt is perhaps cruel but nonetheless accurate to note that the more Adam Schiff, who has replaced AOC as the new face of the Democratic party, goes before the cameras, the more the transitory attention goes to his head, the more he lies, habitually proves unethical, and becomes morally compromised. And the more the public becomes repulsed by him.\nIn just this latest impeachment iteration, Schiff has already lied about his staff’s prior contacts with the “whistleblower,” read into the record a complete rewriting of the presidential call transcript, and leaked supposedly secret statements from his partisan witnesses. In other words, the more one sees and hears Adam Schiff, the more one is likely to dislike him — including his own party’s presidential candidates.\nNancy Pelosi wants to wrap up impeachment as soon as possible before the debates resume in earnest and the primaries start, before the Horowitz and Durham reports, before the bored public wonders where exactly is the smoking gun, and before Trump’s polls get into the high forties. But mostly she just wants to get the off-putting Schiff off the national stage and to end his career as the icon of current progressivism.\n\nWhen Democratic inquisitors are reduced to lecturing the nation that “hearsay can be much better evidence than direct” testimony, and when Adam Schiff looks into the cameras and swears he has no idea who the whistleblower is, then it’s time to pack up the circus and leave town.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\tSomething to Consider\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIf you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

        "articleBody": "\n\t\t\t\n            \nThe road to retiring early isn't easy.Kathrin Ziegler/Getty\n\n\nRetiring early takes time and incredible discipline.\nIf you're planning to retire early, you should aim to have at least 25 to 30 times your estimated annual expenses saved or invested, though that number may be lower or higher depending on the lifestyle you envision.\nDepending on how much you plan to spend annually, you'll generally fall into one of three FIRE (financial independence, retire early) categories: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE.\nTo achieve your target number, live below your means, increase your income, and max out your retirement accounts. \nYou should also aim to pay off all high-interest debt before retiring, which may include paying off your mortgage early. And don't forget to make a backup plan.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes time and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In general, here are the steps you can take:\nHow to retire early\n1. Define early retirement\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live — i.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n2. Take inventory\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances. \n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n3. Establish your target number\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality. \nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help find one) can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal — and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n\n\n4. Live below your means\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\n5. Leverage your income\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term solution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n6. Max out your retirement accounts\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return.\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings — tax-free, at any time.\n7. Invest the money that's left over\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\nNeed help crunching the numbers?

If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\nTommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n9. Research your options for health insurance\n\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\n10. Make a backup plan\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it — would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line. \n11. Put Plan A into action — but enjoy the present, too\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you can.\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire, \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not all we do, either. It is important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those smaller achievements.\"\nRelated coverage from How to Do Everything: Money:\n\n\nHere's exactly how to figure out when you can retire\n\n\nHow to invest in real estate to make money and build wealth\n\n\nHow to get COBRA health insurance if you lose your job or retire early\n\n\nHow to invest in index funds, explained\n\n\n                                    \n                        \n\t\t\t\t\t\n"

Company management said comparable-store sales growth in 2019 will be 3.5%, compared with prior guidance of 4.0%. \n      \n       â€œOur third-quarter results reflected broad-based growth across our business, yet sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits associated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,â€� said CEO Craig Menear in the companyâ€™s news release. â€œWe are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions.â€�  One Home Depot refers to investments intended to create a â€œseamless, interconnected shopping experienceâ€� for customers. In a research report early Tuesday, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski said the market is misinterpreting the results. That creates a buying opportunity, according to the analyst. â€œComp sales were light, though operating margins in-line with expectations,â€� wrote Matuszewski. â€œWe interpret lighter [second-half] results to be more tied to timing of returns on strategic investments versus a softer macro picture.â€�  Heâ€™s not the only one who isnâ€™t all that worried. Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem points out a couple of additional reasons investors shouldnâ€™t fret. â€œWhile certainly a disappointing result, we note that [the company] faced a [0.6% to 0.7%] hurricane headwind in Q3, lumber remains deeply deflationary and Canada a net headwind,â€� wrote Fadem in a Tuesday research report. â€œExcluding these items, we believe Q3 comps would have been closer to 5%.â€�  Still, the stock has slid, and peer \n            Loweâ€™s\n       (LOW) stock is off too, down 1.8%. Loweâ€™s reports earnings Wednesday. Home Depot management hosts a conference call at 9 a.m. ET to discuss results with analysts and investors.  Home Depot shares are up about 40% year to date, easily outpacing the \n        Dow Jones Industrial Average\n       and \n        S&P 500\n       over the same span.

        "articleBody": "Beauty company Coty is breaking out â€” in a good way.The stock added more than 2% to begin the week after the beauty brand took a majority stake in Kylie Jenner's cosmetics company in a deal worth $600 million. Those gains add to a major gain for shares, climbing more than 80% so far this year.Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, says the stock could be a risky bet with a worthy reward.\"This is a stock that until this year had been getting clobbered,\"  Maley said on CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Monday. \"It was down for four straight years, down well over 60%, and the rally has only just recently broken above that multiyear trend line. If it can take it a little bit further and break above $13.60, that will follow that upward break of the trend line with a very nice higher high and will confirm that its long-term trend has broken to the upside.\"\"A little bit more risk but more reward because whenever you buy any stock in the early stages of a change in trend, it always gives you a little more upside potential,\" Maley said.The Coty-Kylie Jenner deal could be the beginning of a new trend for consumer-facing stocks, says John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.\"Here's a company that's willing to pay for the eyeballs and the followers that Kylie Jenner has more so than anything else. So, this could be a new paradigm for the consumer staples, packaged goods industry which, you know, has been suffering because of weak mall traffic and the rise of e-commerce because shelf space has basically become infinite,\" Petrides said during the same segment.Coty acquired a 51% ownership position in Jenner's beauty and cosmetics portfolio, a deal announced at the beginning of the week. Jenner still has a partnership with Ulta Beauty to sell her products in its stores. That relationship began last November and led to several quarters of revenue growth for Ulta.\"I would expect more acquisitions like this going forward because it could be the new model for companies to acquire top-line growth by partnering up with key influencers,\" Petrides said.Disclaimer\n"
