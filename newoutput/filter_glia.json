        "articleBody": "Republicans Are Following Trump to Nowhere\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/opinion/republicans-elections-\nimpeachment.html\n\nThere’s an impeachment lesson hiding in the president’s failure to produce the\npolitical results he wants.\n\nNov. 19, 2019\n\n\n\n**Send any friend a story**\n\nAs a subscriber, you have **10 gift articles** to give each month. Anyone can\nread what you share.\n\n\n\nAmericans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major,\nstatewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature;\nin Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the\ngovernor’s mansion. In each case, President Trump tied himself to the outcome.\n\n“Governor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!”\nTrump tweeted before Election Day. “Matt has my Complete and Total\nEndorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT\nGovernor, @MattBevin!”\n\nTrump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. “Virginia, with\nall of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with\neverything planned, go out and vote Republican today,” he said.\n\n“The people of this country aren’t buying” impeachment, Trump said at a rally\nin Louisiana last week. “You see it because we’re going up and they’re going\ndown.”\n\n“You gotta give me a big win please,” he said later. “Please.”\n\nTrump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead,\nthey did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the\nfirst time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky\nDemocrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in\n2016. And Louisiana Democrats re-elected Governor John Bel Edwards in a state\nTrump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points.\nDemocrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of\nvictory — their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by five-and-a-half\npoints, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago, when Republican Phil Bryant\nwon in a landslide.\n\nIt’s true that Democrats didn’t run on the issue of impeachment. These races\nwere centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and\neducation. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle where\nhealth care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy\nBeshear — whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act\nin the state — promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for\nwork requirements. Edwards ran for re-election on his implementation of the\nMedicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000\nstate residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well,\nwhere an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the\nexpansion.\n\nBut just because no one ran on impeachment doesn’t mean it wasn’t in the air.\nVoters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They\ncould have elevated the president’s allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an\nunambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the president’s\nimmediate political fortunes.\n\nTo start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows\nmajority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that\n“President Trump’s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House\nand removed from office by the Senate.” And an overwhelming 70 percent of\nAmericans say that the inciting offense — Trump’s attempt to coerce Ukraine\ninto investigating a political rival — was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters\npoll has lower numbers for removal (44 percent of Americans say they want the\nHouse to impeach and the Senate to convict), but also shows that most\nAmericans want Congress to investigate Trump if he “committed impeachable\noffenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.”\n\nWorried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have\nlimited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these\nnumbers and election results as vindication — proof that Democrats were right\nto take a narrow, focused approach to the president’s wrongdoing.\n\nBut it’s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the\ntable — that there’s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that\ntackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president’s\nphone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not\njust the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a\nclassified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and\nSaudi Arabia. These wouldn’t be fishing expeditions — given the president’s\nrefusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from\nthose of the state, there’s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior\nacross a range of areas — but they would mean a longer process. Democrats\ncouldn’t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to\nlet it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate,\nremember, took more than two years to unfold.)\n\nI don’t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch\nMcConnell’s hands until there’s a comprehensive case against the president.\nYes, there’s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is\nany prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage\nover the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off-balance,\nespecially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would\nalso allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to\ncampaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a\ntrial. But most important it would show a commitment to getting to the full\ntruth of what’s been happening in the White House under the guise of making\nAmerica great again.\n\n_The Times is committed to publishing_ _a diversity of letters_ _to the\neditor.

He also agreed to return the\ncash he received from the use of “We.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment.\n\nWeWork agreed to a rescue by its largest shareholder, Japanese technology\ninvestment company SoftBank Group Corp, last month as it faced a cash crunch.\nSoftBank agreed to inject $6.5 billion in debt and equity into WeWork and to\nfund a $3 billion buyout of existing shareholders, including $1 billion for\nsome of Neumann’s shares.\n\nWeWork now faces a radical restructuring. Job cuts will be announced later\nthis week in areas that do not support WeWork’s core business goals, said The\nWe Company’s recently named executive chair Marcelo Claure in an email to\nstaff that was reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe _New York Times_ reported on Sunday that WeWork is preparing to cut 4,000\njobs. The company itself had 12,500 employees on June 30, and there are others\nwho work for affiliates.\n\nNext steps to shape the company’s future will be divulged in an all-company\nmeeting on Friday, Claure said in the email.\n\nHe said WeWork needs a more efficient and more customer-centric organization\nto grow. “We are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and\nresponsibilities,” added Claure, who is also an executive at SoftBank.\n\nAn October 11 presentation to bondholders indicated administrative jobs would\nbe cut, along with jobs in WeWork’s venture capital arm and in so-called\ngrowth-related functions, a possible reference to design and construction\nunits.\n\nThis is not the first time WeWork has been scrutinized by the NYAG. The\ncompany rolled back its policy of requiring employees to sign noncompete\nagreements after reaching a settlement with the attorney general last year.\n\nBloomberg News reported on Friday that WeWork is facing scrutiny from the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission over whether it violated financial rules as\nit sought its public listing. WeWork declined to comment on the report.\n\nWeWork’s 2025 bond has weakened sharply in the past week, hitting 16.057% on\nMonday, according to data from MarketAxess.\n\n( _Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis, Joshua Franklin, Koh Gui Qing, with\nreporting by Herb Lash and Megan Davies, editing by Martin Howell._ )\n\n### VentureBeat\n\nVentureBeat's mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-\nmakers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.\n\nOur site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to\nguide you as you lead your organizations.

        "articleBody": "Chris Davies - Nov 19, 2019, 10:31pm CST\n\nVolkswagen’s first ID.3 all-electric car based on the new MEB platform isn’t\nexpected until next year, but the automaker isn ‘t slowing down on stacking up\nnew potential models. The VW ID. SPACE VIZZION is the seventh EV to use the\nmodular electric drive matrix, and its electric Gran Turismo is arguably the\nmost striking yet.\n\nYou could think of it as a futuristic wagon, or of a condensed SUV, or even a\nwell-stretched sedan. Whatever the definition, VW says that while the ID.\nSPACE VIZZION may only be a concept today, it’s weighing a potential\nproduction version for North America and Europe.\n\n\n\nThe MEB’s flexibility shows its strength here, allowing Volkswagen to tinker\nwith the length of its EV and its drivetrain. As shown off at the LA Auto Show\nthis week, the ID. SPACE VIZZION is – at 195-inches – about as long as a VW\nAtlas Cross Sport SUV. However it’s narrower and lower.\n\n\n\nA 275 horsepower electric motor is mounted at the rear, powered by an 82 kWh\nlithium-ion battery, for 406 lb-ft of torque. VW says that it’s enough to give\nthe ID. SPACE VIZZION a near-50:50 weight distribution. There’s electronic\ndamping control, multilink rear suspension, and strut-type front suspension.\n\n\n\nHowever, the car could just as easily be AWD. Add in a 101 hp coaxial drive to\nthe front, and the ID. SPACE VIZZION 4Motion would offer 335 horsepower and\n517 lb-ft of torque in total. VW says that, in such a configuration, 0-60 mph\ncould arrive in 5.0 seconds, and the top speed be an electronically-limited\n109 mph.\n\nAs for range, in RWD form you’re looking at up to 590 km on the European WLTP\ncycle. In the US, Volkswagen estimates that could be more like 300 miles on\nthe EPA cycle.\n\n\n\nHelping there is the aerodynamic slipperiness. VW’s engineers used some clever\nairflow guidance to bring the coefficient of drag down to 0.24, with air being\nguided up through a horizontal panel between the headlights, over the top of\nthe car, and then down through a second horizontal panel over the tailgate.\n\n\n\nDoor handles are done away with in favor of touch pads, again with reducing\nwind drag in mind. Walk up to the ID. SPACE VIZZION and the pads light up;\ntouch one, and it pulses, vibrates, and the door opens. Indeed graphical\nlighting is a big theme in the concept, with the IQ.LIGHT LED headlamps joined\nby an illuminated VW logo and crossbar, along with honeycomb-style LED daytime\nrunning lights. They also act as X-shaped turn signals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurbine-style 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels have five aero flaps, bringing\nthem flush with the wheel arches and helping to avoid airflow interruption.\nThe roof spoiler, too, is functional, helping cut turbulence at the rear.\nThat’s also where you’ll find more LEDs, with the transparent red light strip\ncrossing the white VW logo.\n\nAll those lights allow VW to program in welcome and goodbye patterns, that the\nID. SPACE VIZZION can show as you unlock and lock the car. That even includes\nheadlamps that look like they’re eyes opening.\n\n\n\nInside, there’s seating for four, though VW says it could add a rear bench\ninstead and accommodate a fifth person. Rather than leather, there’s\nAppleSkin, a faux-leather made in part from residual matter from apple juice\nproduction. VW has used chrome-like paint rather than actual chrome, and done\naway with plastic decorative inserts in favor of more AppleSkin. The automaker\nsays it’ll be doing that with all ID. models, and that future iterations of\nthe material will have metallic finishes and ambient illumination.\n\n\n\nThe dashboard relies on a head-up display to deliver the essential data to the\ndriver; a 15.6-inch touchscreen in the center deals with HVAC, entertainment,\nand other settings. Ambient lighting offers 30 colors, and different hues can\nbe assigned to different touch-surface controls. There’s a large, fold-out\ncenter console with more storage and USB-C ports. VW’s 20.7 cubic foot trunk\nhas two electric longboards underneath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven the steering wheel has had an upgrade. VW has equipped it with touch\npanels, and the right-hand stalk is used to select drive, energy-recovery\nmode, park, and reverse. Light is used to deliver messages from the navigation\nand other systems, such as suggesting a lane change, or can even proactively\nchange to more relaxing tones if the driver encounters traffic. Natural\nlanguage voice control is supported, too.\n\n\n\nIn a time when SUVs and crossovers are only growing in popularity, making a\nluxury four-door GT car might seem like an unusual strategy. VW says it hopes\nto put a production version of the ID. SPACE VIZZION into the US market\nsometime in 2022, an example of the flexibility of the MEB platform and the\nability of that to support more niche models in a way that’s still cost\neffective.\n\n",

Since Diwali, despite the\nSupreme Court ban, the air quality has plunged to alarming levels with the\nmonitoring agency announcing air emergency. Sadly, Delhi pollution has become\na standard feature of winter season. With dip in the temperature and slower\nsurface winds, the pollutants have been accumulating in the air that the\nNational Capital is breathing. Amid all this, a news has gone viral on social\nmedia about an ‘oxygen bar’!\n\nYup, you read it right! From The New York Times to the CNN to Condé Nast\nTraveller, almost all major foreign publications have carried the news about\nthis unique ‘bar’. According to reports, this bar is offering oxygen to anyone\nwho is ready to pay Rs 300 for fresh air for 15 minutes. So, is it true? Do we\nhave an oxygen bar in Delhi?\n\nThe answer is YES! News Nation tried to find out about this initiative and\nlanded up on the webpage of the mall located in Delhi’s Saket area that offers\nthis unique service. According to the website, the name of the oxygen bar is\n‘Oxy Pure’. “An Indian start-up based out of Delhi-NCR, Oxy Pure was launched\nwith an aim to improve the quality of the air by eradicating the air\npollutants in a cost-effective manner,” the description on the website reads.\n\nOffering ‘rejuvenating’ experience to the shoppers, the oxygen bar, “consists\nof an oxygen concentrator that purifies the ambient air, facilitating\ncustomers to breathe 80% to 90% pure oxygen from a disposable nasal cannula\nalong with aromatherapy. The session lasts for 10-15 minutes and leaves you\nwith more vigour and energy.”\n\nThe brain behind this well-timed startup is said to be Aryavir Kumar and\nMargarita Kuritsyna. The duo reportedly saw similar oxygen bar in Las Vegas\nand decided to set up similar facility in India. The oxygen bar charges Rs 299\nfor fifteen minutes of pure air. Prices are different for different aromas.\n\nSo now you know that there IS an oxygen bar in Delhi. Are you planning to\nvisit? Also, in case you want to know, the air quality index in Delhi right\nnow is 218, which is in ‘poor’ category.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "The Steelers spent Monday trying to distance themselves from Thursday night's\nfight that led to multi-game suspensions for Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett\nand Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey. Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also\nreceived a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason\nRudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\n\nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson, however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight\non Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his\nrole in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before\nGarrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\n\nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and\nthen claim bullying. … You get what's coming to you. He was protecting\nhimself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off,\nhe's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\n\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine\nRudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he\ndeserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately\nfollowing the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph\ninstigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two\nwere on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before\nGarrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet.\nRudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after\nGarrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to\nrunning back Trey Edmunds.\n\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain\nCam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday\nnight, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to\nsuspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more\nfocused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game\nwinning streak come to an end.\n\n\"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko\nof the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of\nthings, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much.\nThat's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to\nlearn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\n\nThe Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as\nthe NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25\nkickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to\nfacing the Browns again.\n\n\"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I\ndon't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot\n[again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at\nhome, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got\nto put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game,\nso our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\nWalt Disney Co. executive Kevin Mayer said overwhelming demand and a computer-\ncoding glitch led to widespread problems last week when the Burbank\nentertainment giant launched Disney+.\n\nThe company struggled to contend with the more than 10 million users who\nactivated their accounts last Tuesday. Disney’s $6.99-a-month service is\nstocked with movies and TV shows from Pixar Animation, “Star Wars,” Marvel\nStudios and classic Disney fare, including “Mary Poppins” and “Bambi.”\n\nThere were also more mundane issues, such as assisting people who had\nforgotten their passwords. Some consumers who sought help on launch day\nreported telephone wait times that exceeded two hours. Others reported being\nabruptly logged off the service.\n\n“We had some issues ... we had some customer service issues that didn’t make\nme feel good,” Mayer, Disney’s chairman of direct-to-consumer and\ninternational, said Tuesday at the Vox Media’s Code Media conference in\nHollywood. It was his first public appearance since the launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney’s tech teams isolated the problem, Mayer said, and “patched” the\nsoftware as the company continued to sign up additional subscribers throughout\nthe week.\n\n\n\nKevin Mayer, the Disney executive who is overseeing the Disney+ streaming\nservice\n\n(Walt Disney Co.)\n\nAn undisclosed number of customers signed up for the free weeklong trial,\nalthough it is not clear how many have converted to paid subscribers. Mayer\nhinted that the company was pleased with Disney+ retention so far.\n\n“We’ve never had demand that we saw that day, and continue to see ” Mayer\nsaid.\n\nThe streaming service represents a shift in Disney’s business strategy and,\npotentially, another blow to the traditional pay-TV bundle that bolstered its\nbusiness. Accelerated cord-cutting has eroded revenue from Disney’s flagship\nESPN channels, Disney Channel and other cable networks.\n\nWhile traditional companies have experimented with niche streaming services,\nsuch as CBS All Access, Disney has made an enormous bet, spending more than $3\nbillion on technology and programming to remain a leader in Hollywood and take\non Netflix at its own game.\n\nNetflix has been a game changer but no one knows just how much disruption the\nso-called streaming wars will have on the traditional pay-TV industry.\n\n“We will see the industry shake out a bit,” Mayer said. “Not everyone will\nsucceed.”\n\nWall Street analysts are trying to assess which media companies are best\npositioned for success, and how many streaming services consumers will sign up\nfor. Mayer said it depends on the cost of the service, but he said that he\nthinks the number will be between four to six services, depending on whether\nsubscribers continue to pay for a traditional bundle of channels.\n\nHe declined to say when Disney might change its sports strategy and decide to\nstream marquee sports, such as NFL football or NBA basketball on its ESPN+\napp. For now, those big-ticket sports are primarily found on broadcast\nnetworks and the cable channel ESPN.\n\nEventually, Disney is expected to switch gears again by concentrating its\nsports offerings on a more comprehensive ESPN streaming service, a move that\nwould probably cause the pay-TV bundle to collapse.\n\n“There will be a time ... when the pay-TV numbers are low enough,” Mayer said.\n“We want to serve consumers the way they wish to be served.”\n\nGetting Disney+ right will be a key test of Mayer’s mettle. He is viewed as a\npotential successor to Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, and he managed the\ndesign and last week’s rollout of the service.\n\nMayer was named chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international\ndivision in March 2018 after years of serving as a business development and\ncorporate strategy executive at the company.\n\nHe led key acquisitions, including Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm and\nBamTech, the previously little-known firm that provided the technological\nbackbone of Disney’s streaming efforts.\n\nIt’s the first time in Mayer’s career with Disney that he has been in a hands-\non operational role.\n\n“Operating is a lot different than a strategy role,” Mayer said. “ I love what\nI’m doing.”\n\n",

Now we are in a\ngood position to advance.\"\n\nAlthough only one of the matches reached three sets, it took nearly eight\nhours to complete the series at the \"Caja Magica\" (Magic Box) centre court.\nSpain will be back in action on Wednesday against defending champion Croatia.\nRussia beat Croatia on Monday.\n\nIn the revamped Davis Cup format debuting this year, teams play only two\nsingles and a doubles in each tie, with the group winners advancing to the\nknockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers in the six\ngroups.\n\n\"The format makes things very difficult because every mistake puts you in a\nposition that you don’t want to be,\" Nadal said. \"And losing that first match,\nwe were under pressure.\"\n\nSerbia’s Novak Djokovic and Britain’s Andy Murray will make their first\nappearance on Wednesday. Serbia takes on Japan and Britain plays the\nNetherlands.\n\nThe Davis Cup Finals is being played in World Cup-style with all 18 teams\nplaying in a single venue in the same week. It is the result of a 25-year\npartnership between the International Tennis Federation and Kosmos, a group\nco-founded by Barcelona soccer player Gerard Pique.\n\nBrazil star Neymar was among the more than 12,000 in attendance, which also\nincluded a marching band organized by Spanish fans that fired up the crowd\nthroughout the matches.\n\nUS FALLS\n\nThe United States lost to Canada for the first time in the Davis Cup after\nVasek Pospisil edged Reilly Opelka 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7) and Denis Shapovalov\ndefeated Taylor Fritz 7-6 (6), 6-3.\n\n\"Came down to a few points,\" Opelka said. \"Thought I did my part, played well,\nserved well, and I put myself in a position to win. He was just too good.\"\n\nThe U.S. had won all previous 15 meetings with their North American\nneighbours, though they had not met since 1965.\n\nFRANCE WINS\n\nTwo days after clinching the doubles title in the ATP Finals, French duo\nPierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut secured France an opening win.\n\nHerbert and Mahut rallied to defeat Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama of\nJapan 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 in the deciding doubles match in Group A, giving top-\nranked France a 2-1 victory.\n\nThe French duo squandered two match points while serving at 5-4, but\ncapitalized on their chance at 6-5 to clinch the victory for last year’s Davis\nCup runner-up.\n\nThe teams were tied after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga cruised past Uchiyama 6-2, 6-1\nand Yoshihito Nishioka defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-2.\n\nHerbert and Mahut did not drop a single set in five matches at the ATP Finals,\nwhere they defeated Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New\nZealand in the final on Sunday.\n\n\"We know we’ve arrived late from London, but the captain had a lot of\nconfidence in our team,\" Mahut said. \"There was a lot of intensity in the win\nbut we’re really happy today. This was a really difficult tie.\"\n\nARGENTINA CRUISES\n\nArgentina comfortably got past Chile 3-0 in Group C, with Guido Pella beating\nNicolas Jarry 6-4, 6-3 and Diego Schwartzman defeating Cristian Garin 6-2,\n6-2.\n\nThe tie was already decided when Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer topped\nJarry and Hans Podlipnik-Castillo 6-3, 7-5 in the doubles match.\n\n\"It’s the end of the season but I think I played one of the best matches for\nsure of the year, maybe in my career,\" the 14th-ranked Schwartzman said. \"I\nthink Guido helped me a lot to be more confident in this match and I played\nunreal tennis.\"\n\nKAZAKHSTAN WINS AGAIN\n\nKazakhstan also needed the doubles match to beat the Netherlands 2-1 and\nclinch its first away Davis Cup win since 2011.\n\nThe Group E victory came after Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik defeated\nRobin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-4, 7-6 (2). Kukushkin had beaten Botic van\nde Zanschulp 6-2, 6-2, while Haase defeated Bublik 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n\n\"I almost died there,\" Bublik said, jokingly.\n\nAUSTRALIA AHEAD\n\nAustralia beat Colombia behind Nick Kyrgios’ 6-4, 6-4 win over Alejandro\nGonzalez and Alex de Minaur’s 6-4, 6-3 victory over Daniel Elahi Galan.\n\nColombia had lost to Belgium on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen submitting content, please abide by our submission guidelines, and avoid\nposting profanity, personal attacks or harassment.

We always have a baby\ncarrier in the car so for our hike we just had to make a pit stop at Walmart\nfor some easy to carry bottled Arrowhead water and healthy snack bars.\n\n\n\nRed was our water boy for this trip.

Soon after\nwe moved here we went to a festival and he didn’t take our warnings to keep\nhydrated seriously and passed out while waiting in line for a ride. Since that\nday he has never forgotten to make sure he has water at all times when\noutside, especially in the warmer months.\n\n\n\nEven Dub had his Arrowhead water in a cup while getting a piggyback ride from\ndaddy. Our baby carrier is another must-have here. Even though he isn’t a baby\nanymore he still loves to ride in his carrier. This allows us to do more\nhiking than we normally would since we don’t have to worry about him being\nable to keep up or getting tired.\n\n\n\nWhile we’re at home we still have to stay hydrated and would love to one day\npurchase a water cooler for the BPA-free 5-gallon bottles of Arrowhead water.\nHopefully, Walmart will have these available soon so we don’t have to make\nsure we’re home for a delivery.

        "articleBody": "\n\n엘제이의 리벤지인가, 류화영의 코스프레인가\n\n[엔터미디어=정덕현의 이슈공감] 엘제이의 리벤지인가, 류화영의 피해자 코스프레인가. 시작은 엘제이의 일방적인 사진 공개로부터 비롯됐다. 그건\n이 사안을 두고 벌어진 엘제이와 류화영의 진실공방이 어떤 결론을 내더라도 잘못된 일이다. 타인의 동의를 구하지 않고 일방적으로 두 사람의\n관계를 담은 사진을 SNS에 공개한다는 건 분명한 사생활 침해이고, 나아가 ‘리벤지’의 성격을 가진 SNS 폭로로 여겨지기 때문이다.\n\n그래서 처음 이러한 사진 공개에 대한 대중들의 반응은 엘제이의 행동에 대한 비난으로 이어졌다. 하지만 엘제이는 자신의 부적절한 행동들에 대해\n무감한 태도를 보였다. 그는 “너네들이 우습게 봐도 내가 사랑하는 사람의 추억을 간직하는 게 잘못이냐”고 말하기도 했다. 또 “제 여자친구랑\n여행 간 게 잘못인가요”라거나 “이하늘 형님 보고 용기를 얻습니다. 전 형님보다 한 살 어립니다” 같은 글을 남기기도 했다.\n\n‘사랑하는 사람의 추억을 간직’하는 일이 어째서 두 사람만의 사적인 관계를 찍은 사진들을 공개하는 일이 될까. 이런 일들은 사실 연예인처럼\n특수한 위치에 있는 이들만이 아니라, 우리 같은 보통 사람들에게도 일종의 데이트 폭력으로 다가올 수 있는 일이다. 물론 사진 속 다정했던\n모습처럼 서로 좋은 관계였을 때는 이런 사적인 사진들이 하나의 추억이 될 수 있을 게다. 하지만 관계가 틀어지고 나서 공적으로 폭로되는\n사진의 의미는 완전히 다를 수밖에 없다.\n\n그런데 이런 대중들의 반응 때문이었을까. 류화영은 한 매체에 자신의 입장을 털어놓으며, 엘제이와의 관계를 전면 부정했다. 약 1년 전부터\n‘친한 여동생’ 정도의 관계로 엘제이를 알고 지냈으며, 최근 두 달 전 쯤 보다 신중히 서로의 관계에 대해 생각해보는 시간을 가졌으나, 금세\n그의 폭력성과 집착이 드러나 일주일만에 지인으로 남기로 했다는 것이었다. 이 입장을 토로하는 과정에서 류화영은 엘제이의 폭력성향과 협박을\n폭로했다. 그는 이 문제를 ‘데이트 폭력’이라고 분명히 했고 강력한 법적 대응을 논의 중이라고도 했다.\n\n하지만 이러한 류화영의 폭로에 대해 엘제이 역시 반박하고 나섰다. 그것이 전부 거짓말이라며 그 증거들을 제시했다. 그것은 또 다른 폭로일 수\n있지만, 진실을 밝히기 위한 유일한 방책처럼 보이기도 했다. 실제로 그가 내놓은 증거들은 두 사람의 관계가 그저 ‘잠깐 알고 지냈던 사이’\n정도로 보이지는 않았다. ‘가택침입’이나 ‘데이트 폭력’ 같은 자극적인 표현들이 있었지만, 엘제이는 서로 집 비밀번호까지 알고 있었고, 그\n집에서 청소 빨래까지 다 해줬다는 메신저 내용을 공개하기도 했다.\n\n\n\n물론 최초 사진 공개는 분명한 엘제이의 잘못이라고 여겨졌고, 그래서 초기 그에 대한 비난 여론이 집중되었던 것이 사실이지만, 류화영의 폭로와\n거기에 대한 엘제이의 재차 반박이 이어지면서 이제는 류화영 역시 거짓말을 하고 있는 것 아니냐는 여론이 생겨나고 있다. 엘제이가 내놓은\n일련의 증거들이 류화영의 진술을 정면으로 반박하고 있기 때문이다.\n\n사실 남녀 관계라는 것이 당사자들이 아니면 그 속사정을 알기는 어려운 일이다. 게다가 그 사적인 관계의 사안들은 그들 스스로 해결해야 할\n일일 수 있다. 그러니 이러한 공적인 장을 통한 공개와 진실공방은 괜한 피로감만 낳을 수 있는 일이다. 하지만 그럼에도 불구하고 이번\n엘제이-류화영의 진흙탕 싸움은 점점 공적인 사안이 되어가고 있다. 그것은 최근 들어 민감해진 ‘성폭력’ 사안에 대한 두 가지 시선이 그 안에\n교차되고 있어서다.\n\n첫 번째 시선으로서 ‘데이트 폭력’이 어떤 것인가를 이번 사안이 말해줄 수 있다는 점이다. 엘제이는 사진 공개가 ‘사랑하는 사람과의 추억을\n간직’하는 일처럼 말했지만, 그건 분명한 폭력이 될 수 있다. 사랑했던 만큼 이별에 대한 아픔이 남을 수 있겠지만, 그렇다고 상대방의 사진을\n동의 없이 공개한다는 것이 용인될 수는 없다.\n\n두 번째 시선은 거짓말에 관련된 부분이다. 이번 사안에서 사진 공개가 데이트 폭력에 해당되고 그래서 잘못된 일이라는 건 이미 대중들이 모두\n공감하는 바다. 하지만 그 과정에서 류화영이 폭로한 이야기들은 엘제이의 반박 증거들과 배치되는 면이 많았다. 만일 류화영이 했던\n‘가택침입’이나 ‘폭력성’ 같은 이야기들이 사실이 아니라면, 그 부분은 ‘데이트 폭력’이라는 민감한 사안을 오히려 활용한 측면으로 비춰질 수\n있다. 정당한 대응이라도 그 과정이나 방법이 잘못됐다면 역시 문제가 될 수 있다는 점이다.\n\n이 사안이 보다 명백하게 무엇이 진실인가가 밝혀져야 하는 이유가 여기에 있다. 적당히 누가 피해자이고 누가 가해자인가를 익숙한 프레임을 씌워\n여론대결로 가는 건 자칫 또 다른 비슷한 사안들에 대한 전례로 작용할 수도 있기 때문이다. 여론공방이나 진흙탕 싸움이 아닌 좀 더 차분하게\n사안들을 들여다봐야 할 필요가 있다.\n\n정덕현 칼럼니스트 thekian1@entermedia.co.kr\n\n[사진=JTBC, 이매진아시아]\n\n저작권자 ⓒ '대중문화컨텐츠 전문가그룹' 엔터미디어(www.entermedia.co.kr), 무단전재 및 재배포금지\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\nA team led by researchers out of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in\nGreenbelt, Maryland, has confirmed traces of water vapor above the surface of\nJupiter's icy moon Europa.\n\nAnd that's a big deal as the tiny space rock is one of the highest priority\ntargets in NASA's search for extraterrestrial life, according to the agency.\n\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the\nnext best thing: water in vapor form,\" lead researcher and NASA planetary\nscientist Lucas Paganini said in a NASA statement.\n\nAccording to a paper published in the journal _Nature Astronomy_ on Monday,\nthe NASA team discovered enough water vapor being released from Europa to fill\nan Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes.\n\nBut while that sounds like a lot, it was only just enough to be detected from\nEarth.\n\nOut of 17 observations by the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which uses a\nspectrograph to detect the chemical compositions of other planets' atmospheres\nby scanning the infrared light they release or absorb, the scientists only\nspotted water vapor in one.\n\n\"We suggest that the outgassing of water vapour on Europa occurs at lower\nlevels than previously estimated, with only rare localized events of stronger\nactivity,\" Paganini and his team wrote in the paper.\n\nFor many years, scientists have suspected that there's water on Europa's\nsurface, and several observations appear to back up that suspicion.\n\nMore than two decades ago, NASA's Galileo spacecraft found evidence of an\nelectrically conductive fluid on the moon's surface. Then, a 2018 analysis of\nthe data found evidence of massive plumes of liquid. Data previously collected\nby NASA's Hubble Space Telescope supported the existence of the plumes.\n\n\"We performed diligent safety checks to remove possible contaminants in\nground-based observations,\" Goddard planetary scientist Avi Mandell said of\nthe water vapor discovery in the statement. \"But, eventually, we'll have to\nget closer to Europa to see what's really going on.\"\n\nA mission to do just that is already lined up.\n\nNASA's upcoming Europa Clipper mission will get a much closer look at the icy\nmoon's surface as soon as 2023.\n\nThe spacecraft will feature a suite of cameras, spectrometers, and a radar to\ninvestigate the thickness of Europa's icy shell during 45 flybys — and perhaps\nyield further insights into the water vapor above the moon's surface while\nit's there.\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEyOoZ7JpyY>\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\nYet another cloud of choking smoke and dust descended this year upon the 20\nmillion residents of Delhi as winter crept in, reaching “severe” or\n“emergency” levels throughout the region. The dangerous, dirty air arose from\na mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and rural smoke converging over\nIndia’s capital region.\n\nIn November, Delhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter to\ndescribe his city as a “gas chamber.”\n\nThe gray haze led to canceled flights, closed schools, and created a public\nhealth emergency. The government distributed 5 million face masks to\nschoolchildren.\n\nSome air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and pollution\nreached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health Organization. For\nDelhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day. The US\nEmbassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor and reported that\nthe air quality index earned a rating of “hazardous” at points throughout\nNovember.\n\n\n\nThis surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and\nit’s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India. The World Health\nOrganization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the\nmost pollution from PM2.5 — particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter\nthat can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems — were in\nIndia. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there\nwere 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world.\nIndia suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of\nthese deaths. Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies\nof 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.\n\nWhile the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when\npollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for\nyears, even from prenatal exposure. With a growing population throughout the\ncountryand more people moving to densely packed cities, the risk is worsening\nfor Indians.\n\nThe dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many\nemerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies\nurbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem\nwith roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to\ndistinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water\nconservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in\nbetter governance.\n\n### Why Delhi’s air pollution gets so bad this time of year\n\nJoshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of\nTexas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and\ndilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And in November in\nDelhi, there’s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.\n\nIn November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up\ntrapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is\nalso landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.\n\nThen there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhi’s\nmore than 10 million vehicles, like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles\nrun on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke\nmotors. Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80\npercent of the region’s total pollution. Dust from the city’s construction\nboom is also a contributor to the city’s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid\nfuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation.\n\nThese sources contribute to Delhi’s year-round pollution. But there are\nseveral additional factors making air quality even worse in the winter.\n\nAs temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning\nfires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs.\n\nSome of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu\nfestival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off\nfireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October\n27 this year.\n\nHowever, one of the largest sources of Delhi’s pollution in November isn’t\ncoming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of\nyear burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and\nrestore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these\nfires has wafted over the city in recent days.\n\nAdded together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of\nresidents. “It’s like you’re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink\nthat’s plugged up,” Apte said. “It overflows with spectacular consequences.”\n\n### Delhi’s air wasn’t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the\nrise in pollution.\n\n“I’m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never\nexperienced this pollution,” said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the\nCenter for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. “The\n[severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened\nin 2009?”\n\nPrakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is India’s\nbreadbasket, and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this\nregion helped deliver a food surplus to the country.\n\n\n\nHowever, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage\nas farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To\ncombat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of\nSubsoil Water Act.\n\nOne of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice\nproduction typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first\ncultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act\nprohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The\ndelay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers.\n\nBy most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjab’s water\ntable. But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October\nrice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter\nwheat, which is typically sown mid-November.\n\nThese farms are often run by small-scale farmers that can’t hire a large\nnumber of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields\nof the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and\nquickest method to prepare for the next planting — burning crop stubble.\n\n\n\nOf course, it’s not just rural pollution that’s choking Delhi. The urban\nsources of pollution — traffic, construction, cooking fires — have also\nincreased as the region’s population has boomed by more than 7 million people\nin the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl.\n\nTogether, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air\nquality in Delhi in recent years.\n\n### Delhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are\nreluctant to take aggressive action\n\nThis year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting\n210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops\nand explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival.\n\nBrick kilns and factories were shut down. Delhi officials also implemented an\nodd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of the cars off the\nroad on a given day based on their license plate numbers. Roughly 200 teams of\ntraffic police were deployed to enforce the rules. However, the scheme barely\nmade a dent in the amount of pollution.\n\nIndia’s Supreme Court also issued an injunction against crop burning. Yet\nfires continued, showing that enforcement remains a problem.\n\nAdded together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air\nquality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say it’s\nbecause of shifts in the weather — not policy.\n\n“This is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to\nsouth-easterly, which allowed Delhi’s air to slightly improve,” Kurinji\nSelvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment\nand Water think tank told CBS News.\n\n\n\nGetting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the\nsources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. “Part of\nthe challenge is that there’s a character of ‘Oh no, you first,’ ‘No, you\nfirst,’” Apte said. “No one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would\nlead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily\nsharing equal portions of the blame.”\n\nPart of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also\na political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers,\nconstruction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have\na seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid\nthe pollution — many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious\nminority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old\nsectarian wounds.\n\nDespite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during India’s last\nelection cycle. And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to\nstop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning,\ndriving, fireworks, and industrial activity.\n\n“People will be up in revolt, they’ll stop trains, there will be riots, and\nnobody wants to get into this hassle,” Prakash said. “It’s actually a very,\nvery noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto\npoints.”\n\n### Air pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress.\n\nMany cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has\nbeen fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air\nquality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from\ndangerous smog.\n\nIn the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County\nregularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the\ncountry as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air\npollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws.\n\nBut the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many\nhave made important progress in consistently improving air quality by\nenforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology.\nThe persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of\neconomic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries.\n\nThis is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Named for economist\nSimon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is\nimpoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but\nbeyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as\npollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are\nimplemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an\nagrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is\ngetting the worst of both worlds.\n\n\n\nBut Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash\nsaid. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their\nair quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that\nChina’s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian\ngovernment, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories\nand limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it\ngets done. The government has since drastically reduced the amount of\nindustrial and agricultural activity around the city.\n\n“The beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do\nit,” Prakash said. “Nothing stands between the decision and the\nimplementation.”\n\nThat’s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To\nclear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies\nand incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics,\nhelping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their\nharvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble.\n\nIndia also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward\ncharity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers\nand reduce pollution.\n\nWithin Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner\nenergy. “If one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to\npollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,” Prakash said. It’s\nnot just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and\ntrucks.\n\n\n\nThat means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable\nenergy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action\nSummit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would\nmore than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to\n450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in\nfossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIt shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for\neconomic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to\naccept the tradeoffs.\n\nWhile some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used,\na region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make\na difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money,\nand foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing\nmetropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan, and Lagos,\nNigeria. “The problem can be solved,” Prakash said. “But what you need is\npolitical will and a bit of imagination.”\n\n",

        "articleBody": "In a joint statement published Oct. 25, the Russian and Syrian defense\nministries accused U.S. forces in southern Syria’s al-Tanf of controlling\n“bandit formations” and disrupting a United Nations plan to return people in\nthe Rubkan refugee camp to their homes in territory controlled by the Syrian\ngovernment.\n\nThe Pentagon rejected these accusations as “patently false,” and both\nindependent analysts and sources in the Rukban camp told Polygraph.info the\nRussian and Syrian claims are false.\n\n**The al-Tanf base**\n\nThe U.S. will keep its military base in al-Tanf after American troops leave\nSyria under President Donald Trump’s announcement last month. Some 200 U.S.\nmilitary personnel are believed to remain at the al-Tanf base. Middle East\nobservers say the base is vital to preventing weapons trafficking between Iraq\nand Syria.\n\nThe al-Tanf base is located inside a 55-kilometer “de-confliction zone” on the\nBaghdad-Damascus (M2) highway. According to the Pentagon, the base serves as\nan outpost in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nIran, Russia and Syria have been pressuring the U.S. to leave al-Tanf, in\norder to open up a route for Iranian military aid to Syrian government forces.\nThe U.S. base in al-Tanf has been the target of a Russian disinformation\ncampaign, Polygraph.info has previously established.\n\nThe U.S. base is strategically locatednear the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.\n\n#### The Rukban camp\n\nThe Rukban camp, also known as the Berm, is located in the desert near Syria’s\nborder with Jordan. It first appeared in 2014, when Syrians fleeing the\ncountry’s civil war gathered at the border checkpoint there, trying to cross\nover to Jordan.\n\nAccording to the Jordanian government, as of 2016, the country had admitted\nmore than 1.4 million Syrian refugees, overwhelming Jordan’s economy and\ninfrastructure. Jordan closed its borders with Syria and blocked the Rukban\ncrossing point.\n\nThe population in the Rukban camp has fluctuated and currently is estimated at\naround 40,000.\n\nRussia and the Syrian government have been accused of creating a humanitarian\ndisaster in the Rukban camp by blocking the delivery of aid in an attempt to\nforce the U.S. to abandon the al-Tanf base.\n\nThe U.S. military in al-Tanf reportedly has been training the Syrian\nopposition forces known as Maghawir al Thawra, or MaT – formerly the Free\nSyrian Army – to fight against Islamic State.\n\nOmar Lamrani, a senior military analyst at Stratfor, the Texas-based\ngeopolitical intelligence organization, told Business Insider in October 2018\nthat MaT was \"fairly secular by regional standards and has been at the\nforefront of the fight against ISIS.\" Lamrani further described the idea that\nthe U.S. is training the Islamic State or like-minded groups at al-Tanf as\n\"certainly absurd.\"\n\nCharles Simpson, program administrator for the Refugees in Towns Project at\nTufts University’s Feinstein International Center, told Polygraph.info the\nRussian Defense Ministry’s allegations are false.\n\n“I can say with confidence that the U.S. most certainly does not ‘control’ any\nactors there directly,” Simpson said. “From my interviews, it appears all U.S.\ninterventions in the region are indirect and sparse.”\n\n**“… prevent the evacuation of the Syrian civilians from the Rubkan camp”**\n\nA VOA Extremism Watch Desk reporter Nisan Ahmado's source inside the Rukban\ncamp, a Syrian refugee who feared regime retaliation and asked not to be\nidentified, said that the Russian and Syrian defense ministry’s claim is\n“absolutely not true.”\n\n“Not the U.S. nor any of the U.S.-backed rebels in area 55 are preventing\ncivilians from leaving the camp,” the source said. “Many people are afraid to\nreturn to the Syrian regime areas because they are afraid of retribution. They\nwant a safe road to areas in northwest Syria.”\n\nCmdr. Sean Robertson, a spokesperson for Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military\noperation against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, told VOA Pentagon\ncorrespondent Carla Babb on Nov. that the Russian and Syrian defense\nministry’s claim “is patently false,” and that “the United States is not\npreventing people from leaving Rukban.”\n\n“Rukban is another example of the Assad regime’s consistent practice, with\nRussian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using\nthe situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane\nbehavior,” Robertson said.\n\nHe added: “The (refugees) must not be forced to make decisions under threat of\nstarvation or severe deprivation because Russia and the [Syrian] Regime are\nblocking them from access to food and other basic needs. The regime must take\nresponsibility for its choice to starve its own people and the pressure must\ncontinue for Damascus to allow the U.N. to deliver aid.”\n\nUnited Nations spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq told Polygraph.info that the U.N. is\n“working in particular with the International Coalition Forces, who have said\nthey need to undertake a security assessment before providing the necessary\nguarantees to enter the camp, as well as the Government of Syria to ensure\nU.N. access to the shelters in Homs.”\n\nSimpson suggested the most likely reason Rukban residents are refusing to\nleave the camp is fear of Syrian retribution.\n\n“Although Berm [Rukban] residents have not been permitted to cross into\nJordan, their proximity to the border and Jordanian-U.S. joint military border\nsecurity operations and air patrols provide a modicum of protection to\ncivilians against Russian airstrikes and other military activities in the\nregion,” Simpson said. “This is a motivation for residents to stay in Rukban,\nrather than returning to say, Palmyra.”\n\nRobertson, the U.S. commander, said: “The United States does not support\nforced or coerced relocations, including forcing people to move because they\nare hungry. As a principle, we support informed, safe, voluntary, and\ndignified movements of internally displaced persons within Syria.”\n\n",

As sure as pigs can fly Epstein isn't dead. In\nIsraHell by any chance, the refuge to be for all the Jewish trash and\ncriminals?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was this British royal and his PR aides thinking of when he granted a\nhigh-profile interview to the BBC, supposedly to clear his name from\nassociation with sex-trafficker billionaire Jeffrey Epstein?\n\nPrince Andrew, the nearly 60-year-old younger brother of heir to the British\nthrone, Charles, has reportedly told friends and family that the interview\naired at the weekend was a “great success”.\n\nIn it, the British royal blankly denied having sex with underage girls\nsupplied to him by the convicted pedophile Epstein who reportedly committed\nsuicide in August while in custody in a US prison. The denials were in spite\nof the facts that Prince Andrew stayed with Epstein in his New York City\nmansion in the early 2000s and on his private Caribbean island notorious for\nsex parties.\n\nIn a sign of how detached from reality this scion of the British monarchy is,\nthe general public reaction to the interview was a torrent of derision and\ndisgust. Former royal PR aides called it not a car crash, but “an articulated\nlorry crash” performance. Far from clearing his name from years of persistent\nmedia suspicions of culpability in Epstein’s sordid crimes, Prince Andrew has\nleft himself open to prosecution from his own self-indicting words and\nevasions.\n\nThe answers he gave to the BBC interviewer were rife with implausibilities and\ncontradictions. His repeated claims of having no memory of events or of\nalleged sex victims or knowledge of Epstein’s “unbecoming” behavior (classic\naloof royal understatement) were contrasted with his laser-like memory of an\nalibi he cited of being at a pizza restaurant in England with his daughter 18\nyears ago – on the same day it is alleged he raped a 17-year-old girl at a\nhouse in London belonging to Epstein’s madame-procurer Ghislaine Maxwell. A\nphoto of the meeting was denied by Andrew, hinting that it was a fake.\n\nBut perhaps the most telling contradiction was his claim that he visited\nEpstein in New York in 2010 – after Epstein was released from prison for\ntrafficking a minor for prostitution – in order to terminate his friendship.\n\nAndrew claims that he felt honor-bound to visit the pedophile to tell him in\nperson that their friendship was finally over. This purported severance of\nfriendship required the British royal spending three days at Epstein’s orgy\nmansion. Must have been complicated conversations?\n\nDuring the visit, he was photographed having long and serious chats with\nEpstein while strolling around Central Park. Was this to find out how\nvulnerable the royal was from potential scandal fall-out?\n\nOh how very noble and principled of Prince Andrew! How chivalrous! The\nrectitude is so royal as befitting a member of the British Realm. However, all\nthis purported meticulous effort to terminate his friendship with Epstein\ncontradicts his claim in the same interview that the pair were “not close”.\n\nHis seeming principled concern about conducting personal relations\npunctiliously stands in stark contrast to Andrew’s otherwise “lack of remorse”\nor “sympathy” with the victims of Epstein’s sex abuse empire, as expressed in\nthe BBC interview.\n\nLawyers for Epstein’s victims who are suing his estate will find the interview\ngiven by Prince Andrew a treasure trove of material for further questioning by\nprosecutors. His interview on state-owned BBC is tantamount to self-\nindictment, and the US lawyers are demanding the FBI summon him for\nquestioning.\n\nIt is astounding that the prince went ahead with the interview despite advice\nfrom several former royal PR aides not to do so, for fear that the anticipated\nmedia fiasco would inflict disaster on the British monarchy. His mother, Queen\nElizabeth, was said to have been disapproving of the idea.\n\nIt is testimony to how out-of-touch and arrogant the pampered, no-work,\npublicly-funded royals are.\n\nAndrew claims that when he flew Royal Navy helicopters during the Falklands\nWar (1982) with Argentina, he came under intense enemy fire. The experience\nallegedly resulted in him losing the physiological function of his body\nsweating.\n\nThe former pilot may soon be in for a lot more dangerous flak.

        "articleBody": "Monday November 18, 2019 7:45 am PST by Joe Rossignol\n\nFollowing the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple plans to release a new 13-inch\nMacBook Pro with a scissor switch keyboard in the first half of 2020,\naccording to industry sources cited by hit-or-miss Taiwanese publication\n_DigiTimes_. A preview of the report was shared with paying subscribers.\n\n\n\n_16-inch MacBook Pro's new scissor switch keyboard via iFixit_\n\nThe report claims the display size will remain 13.3 inches, although given the\nsource is _DigiTimes_ , we would not completely rule out hopes of a larger\n14-inch display. Wistron and Global Lighting Technologies are said to be among\nthe suppliers of the keyboards for the smaller notebook.\n\nThe new 16-inch MacBook Pro features a redesigned scissor switch keyboard,\nlargely based on the standalone Magic Keyboard for the iMac. Given the tried-\nand-tested design, the keyboard should prove far more reliable than the\ntroublesome butterfly keyboards used across the MacBook lineup in recent\nyears.\n\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro also features a physical Esc key and an inverted-T\narrow key layout. It is unclear if the 13-inch MacBook Pro will follow suit.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously predicted that Apple will transition\nits entire notebook lineup to scissor switch keyboards in 2020, including all\nMacBook Pro and MacBook Air models.\n\nIt would be hardly surprising if Apple completely moves past its butterfly\nkeyboards, which have suffered from issues with sticky, repeating, or\nnonfunctional keys since their inception in 2016. Apple continues to offer\nfree repairs to affected customers as part of its worldwide service program.\n\nThe entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro was last updated in July, while higher-end\n13-inch models were refreshed in May.\n\nRelated Roundup: 13\" MacBook Pro\n\nTag: digitimes.com\n\nBuyer's Guide: 13\" MacBook Pro (Caution)\n\nRelated Forum: MacBook Pro\n\nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nI think we'll see similar updates to what the 16\" received. The bezels on the\n13\" are large, and a 14\" display makes sense along with the magic keyboard,\nimproved speakers and mics, and updated thermal design.\n\nEven if it increases the weight/thickness slightly, this is a \"Pro\" machine\nand I like the direction Apple is taking in that regard.\n\nI think this is it. The slimmer bezels, updated thermal design, and magic\nkeyboard are the redesign, they just started it with the 16\". I think this is\nthe design we've got until they move to mini-LED and ARM.\n\nEdit: I'm going to predict that a FaceID sensor with a upgraded camera is\nlikely to come before the next redesign, but it's probably not going to be\nanytime soon or else we would have seen it in the 16\".\n\n14\" and 16\" make more sense.\n\n14\", 15.4\", and 16\" makes no sense.\n\nMonday November 8, 2021 1:19 am PST by\n\nTuesday November 9, 2021 8:51 am PST by Sami Fathi\n\nAmid a heightened amount of scrutiny and tension surrounding the App Store and\nhow users download and install apps on the iPhone, Apple CEO Tim Cook said\ntoday that customers who wish to sideload apps should consider purchasing an\nAndroid device as the experience offered by the iPhone maximizes their\nsecurity and privacy.

        "articleBody": "\n\nBy Bill Hoppe | Special to the Pioneer Press\n\nPUBLISHED: November 19, 2019 at 8:59 p.m. | UPDATED: November 19, 2019 at\n10:16 p.m.\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. — Hours before Zach Parise’s two-goal performance Tuesday, Wild\ncoach Bruce Boudreau expressed confidence in the veteran winger, saying he\nalways finds a way to start scoring.\n\n“It takes a little longer now, but he’s playing well now, he’s getting a\nlittle bit of confidence back,” Boudreau said before the Wild’s 4-1 win over\nthe Sabres in front of 15,522 in KeyBank Center. “That goes a long way.”\n\nRight now, having scored four times during a three-game streak, Parise is\nbrimming with confidence.\n\nParise’s first-period goals – he scored at 7:14 and on the power play at 19:56\n– gave the Wild a commanding two-goal lead they wouldn’t relinquish.\n\nFor good measure, Parise blocked a shot in the waning seconds of the third\nperiod.\n\n“That’s perfect,” Boudreau said. “It’s the mark of a true competitor doing\nthings for the team.”\n\nBarely a week ago, Parise, 35, had scored just once in a 10-game stretch. Wild\ndefenseman Ryan Suter, who joked about Parise’s penchant for changing sticks,\ncould see the frustration on his friend’s face.\n\n“He’s used to scoring goals, getting points,” he said.\n\nBut Parise has quickly turned around a tepid start in which he scored just\nthree four times in his first 18 games.\n\n“You can go either way,” Parise said. “I was going the other way for a little\nwhile. But I was able to, I guess, work my way out of it.”\n\nParise opened the scoring by stripping Sabres center Casey Mittelstadt in the\nneutral zone and burying Joel Eriksson Ek’s feed on a two-on-one.\n\nHe tipped Suter’s shot in later, a dagger for the Sabres.\n\n“He’s starting to feel it a little bit again,” Boudreau said. “And we need\nthose goals.”\n\nThe Wild still rank at the bottom of the Central Division. Boudreau has been\non his players to avoid looking at the standings.\n\n“It’s hard not to, though,” Suter acknowledged. “We know where we are, we know\nwhat we got to do to get out of it, and I thought tonight we took a good step\nforward.”\n\nBoudreau gave his players a pep talk Tuesday, telling them to “believe in\nyourselves” and that the Wild are a “good team.”\n\n“You’ve beaten some really good teams this year,” he said he said he told\nthem. “You’ve been in every game for the last 10 games. So if you start\nbelieving in yourself, then good things are going to happen.\n\n“I said the same thing when I took over Washington for the first time, because\nI knew they were a good team but they just weren’t playing good.”\n\nThe Sabres, having lost eight of their nine 10 games following a scorching\nstart, have been playing awfully. The Wild could sense their frustrations. In\nthe second period, Sabres captain Jack Eichel went after Eriksson Ek and threw\npunches, although neither player received a fighting major.\n\n“I didn’t really see him coming,” Eriksson Ek said. “He came off my back and,\nlike, I just wasn’t ready for it.”\n\nParise said: “We’ve been there. You could tell we were maybe getting under\ntheir skin a little bit and not giving them a whole lot to feel good about.”\n\nEichel said he was “just trying to spark some energy.”\n\nMeanwhile, Wild goalie Alex Stalock, who subbed for the struggling Devan\nDubnyk, looked strong in his 10th outing this season, stopping 30 shots.\nSabres defenseman Brandon Montour spoiled his shutout bid 17:46 into the third\nperiod.\n\nDefenseman Jonas Brodin had scored earlier for the Wild before winger Jason\nZucker’s empty-net goal sealed it.\n\nThe Wild lost defenseman Matt Dumba, who sat out the third period, to an\nundisclosed injury.\n\n“I haven’t talked to the trainers at all,” Boudreau said.\n\nSign up for Newsletters and Alerts\n\n",

Follow us at Twitter @igndeals._ We bring you the best\ndeals we've found today on video games, hardware, electronics, and a bunch of\nrandom stuff too. Updated 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Black Friday is\napproaching, but several items have dropped in price already. Skip the Black\nFriday rush and snag some of these great deals early. Walmart's Black Friday\nadscan just went up last night and several deals are already available.\n\n## PS4 DualShock Controller in Crystal for $39.99\n\n\n\nThe price of one of the PS4 DualShock controllers has prematurely dropped to\nBlack Friday levels. In my opinion, the Crystal is the best looking of all the\nDualShock controllers. It certainly is one of the most popular. Because of its\ncolor and matte texture, it's also the least likely of your controllers to\nlook grimy after hours and hours of continuous use.\n\n## Nintendo Switch Lite with Pokemon Sword or Shield and Case for $238.99\n\n\n\nSave $31 if you get a turquoise Switch Lite with your choice of Pokemon Sword\nor Shield and a case. Save $21 if you want the Zacian and Zamazenta Edition.\nWe haven't seen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and\nthis bundle is still up to $60 cheaper than getting the original Switch (even\non Black Friday).\n\nGet it at Walmart for $238.99\n\n## King of Monitors: 35% Off Dell Alienware AW3418DW 34\" 3440x1440 1900R\nCurved 4ms 120Hz GSYNC IPS Panel Gaming Monitor with RGB, Now $649.99\n\n\n\nThis is the lowest price we have ever seen for one of the best 16:9 gaming\nmonitors out there. If you're looking for the ultimate beast in gaming\nmonitors, the Alienware AW3418DW should be a tops on your list. Specs include\na 34\" 3440x1440 curved IPS panel display with super wide viewing angles and\n99% sRGB coverage, 4ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility, up to 120Hz\nrefresh rate, and RGB lighting. This is my primary monitor and I absolutely\nlove it, both for work and for games.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $649.99\n\n## New Price Drop: Apple Watch Series 3 38mm Smart Watch for $169.99\n(Originally $200)\n\n\n\nScore the Apple Watch Series 3 right now for the lowest price ever. You'll\nsave $250 compared to getting an Apple Watch Series 5 and let's face it, most\npeople probably won't fully appreciate the ECG or the cosmetic updates\ncompared to the Series 3. What everyone **will** appreciate, though, is the\nextra bank in his or her wallet. The Series 3 features an aluminum case that's\nwaterproof up to 50 meters, built-in heart rate monitor, GPS, and its small,\nsleek, and looks almost identical to the Series 4.\n\n## New Price Drop: 2019 Apple AirPods 2 Wireless Earphones for $139\n(Originally $159)\n\n\n\nIt's a bitter fight to the end to get Apple to drop prices on their very\npopular Apple Airpods. Fortunately, the price of the Airpods 2 has dropped\ntoday to the lowest price we've ever seen.\n\n## 45% Off 65\" LG 65UM7300 4K Smart HDTV, Now $549 Plus $50 Dell eGift Card\n\n\n\nOne of Dell's Black Friday deals have gone live early. Even without the gift\ncard, this is the best price out there for this TV. With the gift card, you're\nessentially getting it for $499.\n\nGet it at Dell for $549\n\n## Dell G3 15 Intel Core i5-9300H 15\" 1080p GTX 1660 Ti Laptop with 512GB SSD\nfor $799.99\n\n\n\n**Use code \"50OFF699\"**\n\nThis is an outstanding price for a GTX 1660 Ti equipped laptop. The GTX 1660\nTi is superior to the GTX 1060 and very similar to the RTX 2060 in raw\nperformance. It's paired with a 9th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of\nmemory, and a generous 512GB solid state drive.\n\n**Use code \"50OFF699\"** to get it at Dell for $799.99\n\n## Netgear Nighthawk R6700 AC1700 Router for $67.77\n\n\n\n**Clip the $10 off coupon on the product page**\n\nThe Nighthawks are one of the most popular AC routers around, for gamers and\nnon-gamers alike. Amazon has over 20,800 user reviews with a strong positive\nscore and I'm not surprised. I have one myself (an older generation Nighthawk\nX4) and have never had problems. Since the vast majority of network adapters\ncan't go over AC1900 speeds (in fact most can't go over AC1200 speeds),\nanything faster than this router is mostly wasted. The exception would be if\nyou run lots of NAS, but then you shouldn't use that over WiFi anyways.\n\nGet it on Amazon for $67.77\n\n## Get Dashlane Password Manager for Free (Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo)\n\n **This sponsored deal is brought to you by Dashlane.**\n\n\n\nIf you're still using the same password (or a variant of the same password)\nfor every site you visit, you're putting yourself at risk. With so many sites\nexperiencing data breaches, it's all but guaranteed that someone's going to\nuncover your login info one day—and if you use the same credentials across\nmultiple sites, those thieves could have access to a whole lot of your\nsensitive personal data. A good password manager can help protect you by\nrandomly generating unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and\nautomatically entering them for no-hassle logins. We rated Dashlane as one of\nthe best password managers of 2019. Dashlane offers a free version of its\nsoftware that allows you to manage up to 50 passwords with autofill\nfunctionality. Upgrade to Premium for $4.99/mo (30-day free trial is\navailable) and that you get unlimited password management, Dark Web\nMonitoring, and secure VPN.\n\nDownload Dashlane Password Manager for Free\n\n## 4 Month of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99\n\n\n\nThis deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but **you\ndon't have to be a Prime member**. Sign up for 4 months of Amazon Music\nUnlimited for just $1. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service\n(or $7.99/mo for Prime members). By default your subscription is auto-renewed,\nbut it is SUPER easy to go to your preferences and opt out of it (just make\nsure you remember). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free\nversions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists\nthat you can stream from your Echo Dot, phone, PC, or other Alexa device.\n\nGet 4 Months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $1\n\n## $10 Off Nintendo Switch Lite and Pokemon Bundle\n\n\n\nSave a little when you get your choice of Switch Lite (Turquoise, Yellow, or\nGray) and your choice of Pokemon (Sword or Shield) from Walmart. We haven't\nseen any mention of a Switch Lite deal during Black Friday, and this bundle is\nstill $50 cheaper than a regular Switch.\n\nGet it at Walmart for $249.95\n\n## New Release: Nintendo Switch Lite Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenta Edition with\nBonus Case (Exclusively at Walmart) for $199\n\n\n\nAfter a very, very long stretch of being unavailable everywhere, the Zacian\nand Zamazenta Editino is back in stock on Amazon. The Switch Lite can play the\nsame titles as the original Nintendo Switch. It's lighter and the controls are\nnon-detachable, although it is still compatible with Joy-Cons or the Switch\nPro controller if you buy them separately. The only caveat is that you can't\nplay in docked mode (i.e. on a TV), but for the majority of you who plan to\nplay the Switch on the go, this is a small price to pay.\n\n## New Release: Last Chance to Buy Pokemon Sword or Shield and Get $10 Amazon\nCredit\n\n\n\n_\"Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its\nmost tedious traditions without losing any of the charm.\"_ Read our Pokemon\nSword and Shield review _._\n\nIf you only want Pokemon Sword OR Shield and not both, then Amazon still has\nthe best deal. Amazon is offering Prime members a free $10 Amazon gift card if\nyou get either version. Normally this deal ends when the game is released, but\nwe confirmed that you do still actually receive the credit. Undoubtedly it\nwill end very, very soon so hurry!\n\nGet Pokemon Sword on Amazon for $58.99\n\nGet Pokemon Shield for $58.56\n\n## 70\" Element 4K UHD Smart HDTV with Roku for $499.99 (Originally $800)\n\n\n\nI think this will be the least expensive 70\"+ TV during the Black Friday\nseason. This TV has Roku built in, which in my opinion is the best integrated\nSmart TV interface available. There's even free shipping and it's eligible for\nextended holiday return (meaning you can return this TV to any local Walmart\nby January for whatever reason).\n\nGet it at Walmart for $499.99\n\n## $15 Off Apple AirPods Pro on Amazon\n\n\n\nThe new generation of AirPods is here just in time for the holiday season, and\nthe upgrades are worth getting merry over.

While some people\ncarry two phones, and \"we love you for that,\" Cook said, most do their\npersonal and professional tasks on the same device.\n\nApple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and eight out of ten companies are\nwriting custom iOS apps, Cook told Benioff.\n\nWhile that progress still lags the consumer world, Cook said he's extremely\nproud of his company's trajectory on that front.\n\nBenioff introduced Cook to the Dreamforce audience as \"someone who has\nredefined what it means to be a chief executive officer\"—and someone he's\nlearned a lot from.\n\nHosting Cook at Dreamforce \"is our dream,\" Benioff said.\n\nTo that, Cook joked that he's not Alicia Keys, the singer who surprised the\nDreamforce audience a couple hours earlier by closing out Benioff's keynote\nwith a couple songs.\n\nBut Apple has had a place in his heart since 1984, Benioff said, ever since he\ndid an internship at the company.\n\nNow his own company, Salesforce, has an increasingly overlapping customer base\nas the two tech giants coordinate efforts to make it easier to do business on\nmobile devices.\n\nBenioff intimately understands the benefits of that collaboration.\n\n\"I run my business on my phone. I have for years. I don’t even own a computer\nanymore and I don’t need one,\" he told Cook. \" You guys have done such a good\njob.\"\n\nSalesforce's CEO marveled at Apple's ability to innovate for so many decades.\n\nCook said the admiration is mutual.\n\n\"I love the way you're constantly taking all the new things and quickly\nincorporating those, whether its Siri shortcuts, or handoffs,\" he told\nBenioff.\n\nAnd they both got a little choked up when considering the history of the Yerba\nBuena theater on the grounds of San Francisco's Moscone Center, where on the\nsame stage Apple founder and legendary CEO Steve Jobs unveiled many products.\n\nCook remembered Jobs rehearsing there for one event and \"going way off script\nin a way that only he could do, making everyone laugh along the way.\"\n\n\"I can feel him and his presence when I come here,\" Cook said.\n\nJobs would typically leave work before him, but always stop by his office to\nexchange notes for the day. It was simple things like that that made him such\na great leader.\n\n\"We all miss Steve so much,\" Benioff weighed in, telling Cook, \"since he\npassed, you've been so true to him and his values.\"\n\nAmong those values is privacy, which Apple views as \"a fundamental human\nright\" and embeds into its products. Another is stewardship of the Earth, Cook\nsaid.\n\nApple, a giant industrial producer, has gone well beyond what it's legally\nrequired to do, challenging itself to run entirely on renewable energy while\nencouraging suppliers to be cleaner as well.\n\nThose values also extend to human rights, and Apple is a strong advocate for\nDACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, or Dreamers, to\nreceive citizenship and be allowed to stay in the United States, where they\ngrew up after entering undocumented.\n\nCook said Apple employs about 450 Dreamers, and he sees \"first hand their love\nof their country and commitment to it.\"\n\nPrivacy, like environmental sustainability, are not \"bolt-on things,\" Cook\nsaid, but instead \"embedded in who we are.\"\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Police released dramatic video showing the rescue of a 8-year-old Fort Worth\ngirl who was ripped from her mother's arms and kidnapped in broad daylight.\nCBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was sentenced\nto life in federal prison.\n\nIn a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the\nkidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child's mother,\nhe drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took\nthe child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her\ninto a room and held her captive.\n\nIt was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's\nroom. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and\nhiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers,\nhaving visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\n\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort\nWorth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family\nfriend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police\nDepartment responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the\nfront passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into\nthe hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry\nbasket.\n\nThe video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and\nWebb eventually came out naked.\n\n\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in\ncustody; we have her.\"\n\nFollowing a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth\ndeliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping\nthe girl.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she\nand her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on\nSaturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother\nknocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\n\nThe victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and\nsmart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical\nfight\" for her daughter's life.\n\n\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for\nand agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison.

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\nThe latest wave of tech-based financial startups have a new angle on the\nbanking sector: They’ll assume that everyone is out of money, then try to\nmonetize their brokeness.\n\nSo-called neo-banks, or challenger banks, have been all the rage in Europe and\nAustralia for the past few years. Now they’re starting to get attention here\nin the US, with names like Chime, Varo, SoFi, Current, GoBank, and even—heaven\nhelp us—booyah!. Yes, the exclamation point is part of the name. Like Yahoo!.\nCutting edge, I know.\n\nThese neo-banks have been trying to make money in the usual ways: By taking a\ncut of credit or debit card transactions, collecting interest on consumer\ndeposits, and making loans. The usual banking stuff.\n\nTheir come-on is that they’re super-convenient, all-digital, mobile\nalternatives to the big banks. Better yet, they’re focused on their customers’\n“financial health,” as one neo-bank CEO told me, and easing the “pain” that\npeople feel around their money.\n\nWhat makes that pain go away? At Chime and Varo, you can get what sounds a\nlittle like a neo–payday loan—your paycheck cashed, up to two days before your\nactual payday. Checking accounts at these startups are often free, and the\ncompanies will let you go $50 or $100 into the red before they start charging\nany overdraft fees. Some have automated savings accounts that invisibly funnel\na few dollars from your paycheck into savings.\n\nThese neo-banks aren’t necessarily even banks at all; some are apps that\nfacilitate transactions, which are then carried out by partners that _are_\nbanks. Others have applied for bank charters while touting their homegrown\ntechnology stacks and hyperpersonalized product offerings (based, of course,\non your personal data). But all of them say, explicitly or by intimation, that\nthey’re mission-driven. Their mission is the hot mess that is your finances.\n\nThe hot mess is very real. Seventy-eight percent of Americans live paycheck to\npaycheck. Student loan obligations in this country total $1.5 trillion, and\nresearchers believe they’re cutting into millennials’ ability to buy homes,\nhave kids, and save for retirement. More than 40 percent of households have\nsome credit card debt: The average liability is more than $5,000, and the\npoorer you are, the more you’re likely to have.\n\nSo what better fix than to slap a slick veneer of tech over basic banking\nservices, push the ouroboros paycheck cycle up by a couple of days, offer some\nbasic budgeting tools, and call it a revolution in consumer banking?\n\nBetter banking isn’t a bad idea, nor is it a tough sell. There’s definitely an\nambient frustration with the megabanks that have destroyed the global economy,\nbilked consumers with fake accounts and hidden terms, propped themselves up on\nthe comfortable elbow of your overdraft fees, routinely discriminated against\npeople of color, and on and on and on. I mean, there really _should_ be a\nmission to take customers away from these companies. At minimum, it’s smart to\ncapitalize on all of this well-earned consumer rage.\n\nStill, it’s deeply depressing to attend a large gathering of executives,\nfounders, and industry veterans, as I did at October’s Money 20/20 conference,\nand hear the same, somber message repeated over and over again: The future of\nmoney will be predicated on the fact that the personal finances of the next\ngeneration are as fragile as a Fabergé egg. This, according to attendees and\nspeakers, is both a problem and an opportunity. No one bothered mentioning\nthat the sick state of the nation’s finances isn’t technology’s problem to\nsolve.\n\nIn fact, the idea that the solution to our financial woes can be found in a\nmore convenient, higher-tech, friendlier-named digital bank feels a little\nlike the last story we heard from the tech industry: That the very idea of\nwork could be disrupted by a bunch of apps, too.\n\nNo one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation’s finances isn’t\ntechnology’s problem to solve.\n\nThe same business logic—that you’re trapped in a sad, hellish existence\ndictated by megacorporations, and tech can free you like Neo from the\nMatrix—underlies the entire gig economy. It’s the basis for another tech\nveneer, this one layered over people’s inability to find meaningful work for\nreasonable pay. Uber got into the financial services game recently, with Uber\nMoney. The headline feature? Real-time earnings for drivers and delivery\npeople, so they can collect immediately, instead of weekly.\n\nIn fact, we can use the evolution of the gig economy as a case study for how\nthe latest wave of banking disruption might play out.\n\nThere was a lot that was appealing about the gig economy at first. Those Uber\n“side hustle” commercials were super cool back in 2016, when driving for Uber\nor Lyft or Postmates, or shopping for TaskRabbit or letting out a room on\nAirbnb to cover your hiked-up rent, actually seemed like an opportunity rather\nthan a necessity. Remember when this was about making “extra” money, instead\nof just barely enough?\n\nIt was only scale, and the hard realities of American economics, that made\nthese things look a little less consumer-friendly a few years later. As Uber\nand Lyft grew, driver pay went down. Word got out that unicorn-like businesses\ncould be built by replacing paid employees with a massive network of\nindependent contractors. The model spread. Enter Lugg, Instacart, DoorDash,\nGrubHub, Prime Now, and Homejoy.\n\nThis phalanx of apps comprises an army of independent contractors who hope for\nenough tips to make their labor worthwhile. As their finances have cracked\nunder the strain of small checks, no benefits, and a near-total lack of\nretirement savings, I guess it was only a matter of time before a fresh set of\napps—the neo-banks—were deployed amid the chaos.\n\nI’d like to think the mission-driven companies flooding into the US market for\nfinancial services will be better for consumers. In the short term, that seems\nplausible. Cool features, fewer fees, and a helpful person on the phone or\nonline chat could make us happy. Let’s not forget, many people really hate big\nbanks and would rather take their business elsewhere.\n\nBut there are two problems with this potential disruption.\n\nOne, it might _not_ end up being so consumer-friendly in the long run. Uber\nand Lyft ended up paying drivers less as their revenue pressure grew, and\nthey’re raising prices for consumers. Many riders will tell you the quality of\nthe driving, the cars, and the experience has declined over time, which is\nboth inevitable with growth and not surprising given the shrinking pay and\nincentives.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nThat will almost certainly also be the case with these neo-banks. Banks won’t\nlie down and let the disruption happen—they’ll almost certainly buy some of\nthese upstarts and reabsorb reluctant customers. Big Tech incumbents are\nalready homing in on the space. Apple’s (issue-laden) credit card, Amazon’s\nsmall business loans and unknown future ambitions, Google’s forthcoming\nconsumer checking accounts, and Facebook’s payment wallets could all eat into\nthe market for new companies.\n\nWhether it’s due to competition from banks, each other, or bigger tech\ncompanies, neo-bank startups will inevitably go out of business, leaving\nconsumers stranded. That’s pretty disruptive when you’re talking about your\nchecking account. And at some point, the neo-banks will have to make more\nmoney, which means their offerings will get less generous over time.\n\nA second problem is more serious. Ultimately, no amount of friendly design,\naccessible features, and overdraft protections will solve the underlying\nproblems that made these services necessary in the first place. No neo-bank\ncan erase the student loan debt or the 40-year stagnation in wages or the\nunexpected medical expenses or the crippling reality of America’s existential\nbrokeness. The neo-banks have promised that they’ll ease your pain, but that’s\njust morphine for the real condition. When it comes to the actual sickness,\nyou’re still on your own.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n* YouTubers must unionize,\n\n(@mollywood) is an Ideas contributor at WIRED and the host and senior editor\nof _Marketplace Tech_ , a daily national radio broadcast covering the business\nof technology.

        "articleBody": "By admin - 2018-09-16\n\n\n\n**As of 29 November 2018** , thirty artworks will light up the city center of\nAmsterdam for the seventh year in a row. For this years’ edition of\n**Amsterdam Light Festival** artists, designers and architects from sixteen\ndifferent countries share their interpretation of the central theme **‘The\nMedium is the Message’**. All participating artworks will be lit\nsimultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition –\nin the historical center of Amsterdam – which can be experienced in different\nways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time,\nvisitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be\npresented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the\nfestival. **Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019**.\n\n_Cover image: artist’s impression of the lighting installation by Peter Koros\nDesign at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival_\n\nA selection of the participating artists and artworks:\n\n**Ivana Jelić and Pavle Petrović** (Serbia) found inspiration for their work\n**Starry Night** in Van Gogh’s famous painting of the same name. Since the\nbeginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution,\nstarry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation\nStarry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night\nback, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\n\n**Groupe LAPS** (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and\noften integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the\nfestival, the French artist collective designed **Spider on the Bridge** :\neighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on\nthe bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion\nthat the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors\nare warned!\n\n**Amigo & amigo** (Australia) – also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone\nChua – explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their\ntechnically complex artworks. **Parabolic Lightcloud** is a cloud of light\nmade with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this\ninstallation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors\nto think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts.\nMoreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope\nmade out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\n\n**OGE Group** (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and\nGaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work\nis characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with as a\nclear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment you blow the fluff off\na dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the air. Eitan and Zahr\ncherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions float above de\nHerengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the festival.\n\n**Balmond Studio** (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The\nstudio’s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With\n**Optilli,** Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the\nsubjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon\nas the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The\nquestion is: is the displayed image correct?\n\n**Light as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam**\n\nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty\nartworks. This years’ exhibition revolves around the theme **‘The Medium is\nthe Message** ‘, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and\nphilosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the\nway we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The\nparticipating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play\nas a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise\nhave remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories\nis also a central part of this edition.\n\nOn behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of\nremarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be\nreleased as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn\nidentifies the connection between the city and the central theme.\n\n**Some of the lighting installations on show at the 7th Amsterdam Light\nFestival – previews**\n\n\n\n_Light a Wish by OGE Group_\n\n\n\n_Parabolic Lightcloud by amigo & amigo_\n\n\n\n_Portam Civitatis by Peter Snijder_\n\n\n\n_Spider on the bridge by Groupe LAPS_\n\n**7th Amsterdam Light Festival**\n\n**29 November 2018 | 20 January 2019**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is larger than the planet\nMercury.\n\nOrganic materials - carbon-based compounds critical for fostering living\norganisms - play a leading role on Titan.\n\n\"Organics are very important for the possibility of life on Titan, which many\nof us think likely would have evolved in the liquid water ocean under Titan's\nicy crust,\" said planetary geologist Rosaly Lopes of NASA's Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory in California.\n\n\"Organic materials can, we think, penetrate down to the liquid water ocean and\nthis can provide nutrients necessary for life, if it evolved there,\" added\nLopes, who led the research published in the journal _Nature Astronomy_.\n\n\n\nThe first global geologic map of Titan. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU\n\nOn Earth, water rains down from clouds and fills rivers, lakes and oceans. On\nTitan, clouds spew hydrocarbons like methane and ethane - which are gases on\nEarth - in liquid form due to the moon's frigid climate.\n\nRainfall occurs everywhere on Titan, but the equatorial regions are drier than\nthe poles, said study co-author Anezina Solomonidou, a European Space Agency\nresearch fellow.\n\nPlains (covering 65 percent of the surface) and dunes (covering 17 percent of\nthe surface) made up of frozen bits of methane and other hydrocarbons dominate\nTitan's mid-latitudes and equatorial regions, respectively.\n\nTitan is the only Solar System object other than Earth boasting stable liquids\non the surface, with lakes and seas of full of methane being major features at\nits polar regions. Hilly and mountainous areas, thought to represent exposed\nportions of Titan's crust of water ice, represent 14 percent of the surface.\n\n\"What is really fun to think about is if there are any ways that those more\ncomplex organics can go down and mix with water in the deep icy crust or deep\nsubsurface ocean,\" JPL scientist and study co-author Michael Malaska said.\n\nNoting that on Earth there is a bacterium that can survive just on a\nhydrocarbon called acetylene and water, Malaska asked, \"Could it or something\nlike it live in Titan deep in the crust or ocean where temperatures are a\nlittle warmer?\"\n\nThe map was created seven years before the US space agency is set to launch\nits Dragonfly mission to dispatch a multi-rotor drone to study Titan's\nchemistry and suitability for life. Dragonfly is scheduled to reach Titan in\n2034.\n\n\"It is not only scientifically important but also really cool - a drone flying\naround on Titan,\" Lopes said. \"It will be really exciting.\"\n\n",

The 777 program has faced delays due to engine\nproblems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\n\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of\nBoeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The\norder is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is\ntypically negotiated by airlines.\n\nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have\nbeen badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet\nin less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of\nroughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\n\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to\nBiman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its\nlaunch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60\nof the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress,\nKazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference\nthat the airline — the largest international carrier in the world — will\nrecommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of\nconsolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates\nfleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\n\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In\naddition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50\nAirbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The\nA350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the\nFrench plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-\nbody A350.\n\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest\nairliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of\nthe jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would\nscrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the\nindustry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more\nfuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.\n\n",

The demand has US\nofficials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US farm goods, promises of\nimproved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect\nintellectual property are enough to ask in return.\n\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back\nexisting tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of\ntariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper\nconcessions from China.\n\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger\nthan just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China\nscholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will\nagree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it\nwill benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to\nsee China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US\nmaintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\n\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to\ncampaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to\nvoters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product\npurchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand\ndictate deals instead.\n\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion\nworth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from\nthe 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and\nconsumer goods.\n\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in\nannual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he\nwould likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US put in place since\nthe trade war started in 2018.\n\nTrump and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such\nconcessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual\nproperty and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a\nsecond person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\n\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US on any deal, and hasn't committed\nto any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\n\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that\nI like. If they don't, that's it.\"\n\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an\nOctober news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could\nnow be pushed into next year, trade experts say.\n\nDeccan Herald News now on Telegram - Click here to subscribe\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\n",

(Image credit: TNG Collaboration)\n\nThe formation of galaxies is a complex dance between matter and energy,\noccurring on a stage of cosmic proportions and spanning billions of years. How\nthe diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from\nthe fiery chaos of the Big Bang remains one of the most difficult unsolved\npuzzles of cosmology.\n\nIn search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most\ndetailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call\nTNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains\ntens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen\nonly in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion\nparticles representing dark matter, gases, stars and supermassive black holes,\nover a 13.8-billion-year period.\n\nThe unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key\ninsights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped\ngalaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black\nholes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two\narticles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal Monthly\nNotices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\n**Related:** **From Big Bang to Present: Snapshots of Our Universe Through\nTime**\n\nTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the IllustrisTNG Project, which aims\nto build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big Bang by\nproducing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details of\nindividual galaxies.\n\n\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting\nand understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said\nPaul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and\nco-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're\ngetting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies\nthat give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems\nlooks like as they form and evolve.\"\n\nThe model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required\n16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany,\nrunning continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a\nsingle processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most\ncomputationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers\nbelieve their investment has paid off.\n\n\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get\nout more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max\nPlanck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the\nstudy, said in a statement. \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not\nbeen programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in\na natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical\ningredients of our model universe.\"\n\n\n\nThat emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe\nappears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed\nresearchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent\nclouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered\nthat the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally\nemerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including\nspiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive black\nholes. When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life\nobservations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively\nconsistent with reality.\n\n**Related:** **The 15 Weirdest Galaxies in Our Universe**\n\nAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks,\nanother phenomenon began to emerge. Supernova explosions and supermassive\nblack holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas.\nThese outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years\nabove a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back\nunto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a\nfeedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients\nfor forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's\nstructure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into\nthin rotating disks.\n\nDespite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their\nmodel. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for\nastronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\n\n\"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations\ncompleted,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better\nunderstand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent\ntrends show up in that data.\"\n\n15 Amazing Images of Stars\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Chris Davies - Nov 19, 2019, 8:15pm CST\n\n\n\nAudi has revealed the second production model in its e-tron all-electric\nrange, with the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback making its debut at the LA Auto\nShow. Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro\nelectric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range.\nUS range is yet to be tested.\n\nIt’s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of\nthe original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet\nwide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive\nside profile.\n\n\n\nAt the front, there’s Audi’s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts\nin light platinum gray. It’s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the\nindividual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi\nsays, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road\n– such as markings – with extra-precision.\n\n\n\nFor the rear, there’s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED\nclusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a\nnew Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch\ntrims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody\nprotection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be\nfinished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging\nflap.\n\n\n\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air\nsuspension as standard. It’ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper,\nand larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there\nare body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A\nblack styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and\nbumper.\n\nEurope will get the option of Audi’s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the\nstandard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag.\nHowever US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal\nregulations.\n\n## Power and Performance\n\nIn Europe, there’ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the\ne-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They’ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery\ncapacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\n\n\n\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That\npromises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6\nseconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\n\nIt’ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to “S” and stomps\non the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of\ntorque, lasting for eight seconds. It’s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7\nseconds.\n\n\n\nQuattro is standard, and there’s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic\nbrakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select – with\nseven different drive modes – will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can\nlower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its\nheight by a total of 3-inches.\n\n## Range and Charging\n\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the\ne-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It’s worth noting, though,\nthat those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more\ngenerous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual\nside mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\n\n\n\nStill, there’ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that\nthe Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty\nminutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\n\nFor Level 2 stations, there’ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22\nkW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge\n– which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by\nplugging it in – will also be enabled in 2020.\n\n\n\n## Interior and Technology\n\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom\nversus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or “frunk,” you’re\nlooking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to\n58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\n\n\n\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi\nvirtual cockpit and the automaker’s twin-touchscreen infotainment system.\nThere’ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with\noptional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option,\nas will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\n\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi’s phone\nbox which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper\ntouchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the\n8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is\noptional.\n\n\n\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing,\nwhile navigation is also standard. In Europe, there’ll be integrated Amazon\nAlexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning,\nremote charging control, and other features; it’ll also be used to control a\nnew “functions on demand” system which allows lighting, driver assist, and\ninfotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent\nbasis.\n\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi\nassist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic\nassistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise,\nturn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park\nassist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi\nfits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve\nultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\n\n\n\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick\nthings off with the e-tron Sportback “edition one”: it’ll be a special launch\nedition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro\n($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\n\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron\nSportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next\nyear.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Crossovers may have become the vehicle of choice for most car buyers, but that\ndoesn't mean the sedan is no longer relevant. In fact, Nissan still believes\nin sedans for their practicality, space, as well as looks.\n\nAfter debuting the all-new Juke two months ago, Nissan has taken the covers\noff the eighth-generation Sentra. Featuring a new head-turning design that is\npaired to a more luxurious-looking cabin, the compact four-door has been\nredesigned from the ground-up and is more vibrant than ever.\n\n\"Nissan has a vibrant portfolio of new-generation sedans for customers in the\nU.S. Market. With more than 6 million Sentra vehicles sold, we believe the\nall-new Sentra will reach new heights offering refinement and quality,\ntechnology and performance not seen before. The lower stance and more athletic\ndesign cues from the Maxima sports sedan give Sentra a sexy new look,” said\nDavid Kershaw, division vice president, Nissan Sales & Regional Operations at\nNissan North America Inc.\n\nTaking on a sleeker appearance, the 2020 Sentra gets a new V-Motion front\ngrill that is complemented by a pair of eye-catching LED headlights. It also\nhas a more sculpted hood which further accentuates the Sentra's sportier\ndesign. Wraparound taillights, meanwhile, give the sedan a sophisticated\nfinish and are of the LED kind as well. A blacked roof along with five-spoke\nalloy wheels provide the 2020 Sentra an unmistakable look.\n\nInside, the Sentra's interior has been refined and is covered in high quality\nmaterials. The seats, the dashboard panel, as well as the steering wheel are\nall wrapped in fine leather. It also has contrast stitching which spruces up\nthe overall look of the cabin. To improve riding comfort for the driver and\nfront passenger, it has Nissan's NASA-inspired Zero Gravity Seats and come\nwith a heated function.\n\nIn-car infotainment comes courtesy of an 8-inch touchscreen display. It comes\nstandard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Nissan Connect. It\nalso doubles as a display for the Intelligent Around View Monitor which allows\nfor safer parking / maneuvering.\n\nAn all-new 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine replaces the\nprevious 1.8-liter from before. It puts out 151 PS along with 197 Nm of\ntorque; which Nissan claims is a 20% and 16% improvement respectively compared\nto the older engine. Besides having more oomph, Nissan said that the new\n2.0-liter will deliver better fuel efficiency.\n\nA bevy of active and passive safety features are available on the 2020 Sentra.\nThese include 10 airbags, rear door alert, intelligent forward collision\nwarning, as well as intelligent driver awareness. Aside from those, driver\nassist systems such as automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, rear\nautomatic braking, and high beam assist are also available on the 2020 Sentra.\n\nThe all-new sedan is set to go on sale in the US in late January. As to when\nwill this arrive in the Philippines, we're not entirely sure yet. However,\nsince the Sylphy already debuted in China last April 2019, maybe it's only a\nmatter of time before it gets to the ASEAN region. Who knows, maybe its next\nappearance will be at the 2020 Bangkok International Motor Show which might\nsignal its arrival to the Philippine market some time next year.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "## Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen went under the knife for a routine\nsurgery in 2009. Hours later, she woke up as a different person — and became a\ngreat songwriter.\n\nThe bizarre odyssey of how Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen came to co-\nwrite the euphoric power-ballad that Jessie Buckley performs at the end of\n“Wild Rose” — easily the year’s best original movie song — began 10 years ago,\nwhen the “Melvin and Howard” star woke up after a minor arm surgery feeling\nlike her mind was on fire.\n\n“I felt strange as soon as the anesthesia started to wear off,” Steenburgen\nsaid. “The best way I can describe it is that it just felt like my brain was\nonly music, and that everything anybody said to me became musical. All of my\nthoughts became musical. Every street sign became musical. I couldn’t get my\nmind into any other mode.”\n\nFun as that might sound in an Oliver Sacks kind of way — the late neurologist\nwrote about similar, potentially stroke-inspired symptoms in his book\n“Musicophilia” — Steenburgen wasn’t thrilled about the sudden mental shift.\nThe next two months were tough. “I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t have acted,” she\nsaid. “I couldn’t have learned any lines. My husband [actor Ted Danson] and I\nwere kind of frightened about it.”\n\nSteenburgen’s son, filmmaker Charlie McDowell (“The Discovery,” “The One I\nLove”), also remembers it as a trying time. “If your mom comes to you after\nsurgery and says that her head is now full of music, I think it’s totally fair\nto think that she’s gone crazy and has major psychological problems,” he said.\n“All of a sudden she was referencing these obscure indie bands and picking up\nrandom instruments — I’m not gonna lie, the accordion playing drives me nuts,”\nMcDowell laughed. “When I say all this out loud it sounds insane. It was\ndefinitely a change.”\n\nDespite the paucity of roles for women in their mid-50s, the actress wasn’t\nexactly itching to do something else. “I had been somebody who really liked\nmusic,” she said, “but I had never been obsessed with it; I was obsessed with\nacting, and that felt like a big enough subject for me.”\n\nWhen the music didn’t go away, Steenburgen realized that she had to do\nsomething with it — if only for her sanity — even though she didn’t know how\nto play an instrument. “I called a very talented friend of mine on Martha’s\nVineyard and I said: ‘Look, if I come over every day and sing what I hear in\nmy head, could you help me make them into songs?’” she said. She wrote\nhundreds of songs that summer and sent 12 of the best ones to a music lawyer\nunder her mother’s name. “He wanted to work with ‘Nellie Wall,’ but then I\nshowed up instead,” she said.\n\nThe next thing she knew, Steenburgen had been signed to Universal as a\nsongwriter and was on a plane to Nashville. It was the first stride on a\nstrange path that would eventually lead to Tom Harper and Jessie Buckley’s\ndoorstep almost a decade later.\n\nFlash-forward to 2017, when Harper — a young British filmmaker hot off\ndirecting a lush BBC adaptation of “War & Peace” — had just found his next\nproject. He’d fallen in love with an electric Nicole Taylor script called\n“Wild Rose,” a fish-out-of-water story about a self-destructive Glaswegian\ncountry singer and single mom whose only dream in life is to sing Patsy Cline\nballads at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry. Buckley — who landed a key role in “War\n& Peace” after surging to fame on the U.K. singing competition “I’d Do\nAnything” — had agreed to play Rose-Lynn Harlan, and Harper knew in his bones\nthat she was perfect for the part.\n\nThere was just one problem: The climactic song that ties the whole movie\ntogether didn’t exist. The script called for a soaring, original anthem that\nRose-Lynn belts to a loving hometown crowd in the very last scene after she’s\nlearned to reconcile her dreams with her reality in a way that makes them both\nfeel a little more special, but no details. Phoning in from London, Harper\nremembered the anxiety of moving forward without that crucial missing piece:\n“The script just said something along the lines of, ‘Rose-Lynn sings an\nincredible song and it conveys everything that she wants to express to her mom\nand kids and everyone’s uplifted. The end,’” Harper said. “I had faith that we\ncould figure it out, but it was really worrying.” Universal’s music division\nprovided some demos, but none of them clicked.\n\nAt the last minute, a sample came in called “Glasgow (“No Place Like Home”).\n“It grabbed me by the heart the moment I heard it,” he said. “It just\nconnected.” Buckley, who phoned in from the Chicago set of “Fargo,” had a\nsimilar experience: “It was just that immediate feeling of ‘this is the\nsong.’”\n\nThat’s when Harper and Buckley first learned who had written it, and found\nthemselves blindsided by “the Mary Steenburgen of it all.”\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/embed/mR3SM29DzCc>\n\nAs it turned out, Steenburgen had spent the last few years toiling away on her\nown dream of making it in Music City. And despite the many advantages that her\nfame might have afforded her, she was more nervous about going there than\nRose-Lynn Harlan has ever been about anything. “It was terrifying,” she said.\n“The first session I did was a total disaster, and I literally went back to my\nhotel room in tears, cried my eyes out, and thought ‘Why would anyone be so\nstupid at age 54 to think they could do something so new?’”\n\nBut she also felt like she didn’t have much of a choice. “I was back at it by\nthe next morning,” she said. “I just told myself: ‘I’m going to go right up\nand sing the bleeping song if it kills me!’” Not long after that, Steenburgen\nbought a house in Nashville.\n\nMcDowell still laughs at the memory of hearing his mom spontaneously begin to\nscat in the backseat of his car. “It could have been really easy for Mary\nSteenburgen to just put her name on something and get a pass on many of the\nusual steps in some new creative thing, but she didn’t do that,” she said.\n“She put in the time to learn the craft, and I respect that. And I have to\nadmit, she’s gotten really good at the accordion.”\n\nSteenburgen’s career experience also gave her a unique advantage over the\ncompetition: While most of the songwriters who submitted demos for “Wild Rose”\nwere content to read a plot synopsis and work in broad strokes from there,\nSteenburgen approached the assignment as if the song were a character for her\nto play. “I fought to get the full script, because I just felt like I was\nlooking at such a small part of the story without it,” she said. “Where does\nRose-Lynn live? What does her apartment look like? I needed to think of\nimagery that might be cohesive with what the production designer, the\ncinematographer, and the composer would be doing; there are all these people\nyou haven’t met yet who are telling the same story. And as soon as I read the\nwhole thing, I understood what we were writing.”\n\nThat process led to a realization: “It was a really love song from Rose-Lynn\nto her mother …It was also a love song to her city and a love song to the\nconcept of home and the fact that home doesn’t have to be second best for her\nor something that she settles for.”\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhMZ6ADitjM>\n\nBoth accomplished songwriters who had previously written music for the\ntelevision show “Nashville,” Steenburgen’s co-writers Caitlyn Smith and Kate\nYork came to the project with a similar appreciation for the challenge of\nwriting character-driven chords. “It’s a totally different muscle,” York said.\n“You have to take yourself out of it a little bit — it’s kind of like acting,\nI guess.” Smith agreed: “It’s a different job altogether. If you’re just\nwriting a song for someone else, it’s wide open and sometimes hard to figure\nout. And if you’re writing for yourself, you’re really digging into your own\nheart.” This particular task was a little bit of both. “I feel like we could\nget into the guts of this song because we’ve all lived a similar crazy dream\nstory,” Smith said.\n\nThe first thing they found out is that Rose-Lynn worships Patsy Cline, and so\nthe three writers knew they had to craft something with classic country DNA\n(not an obvious assumption in a film that builds to a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it\ncameo from a genre-bending superstar like Kacey Musgraves). Smith seized on\nsomething with a 6/8 feel, and they all decided to stay there. But the\nsongwriters also reckoned with the role that Glasgow plays in Rose-Lynn’s\nlife, and not just as an albatross around her neck.\n\n“Anything we wrote had to have a fond hint of Scotland,” Steenburgen said. “So\nI called one of my best friends, a Scottish woman who started out as a nanny\nand ended up like a sister,” a detail that dovetails eerily well with the plot\nof the film. “So I called her up and said ‘Talk to me in your accent — talk to\nme about you.’ And through that we wound up with images like the opening line:\n‘I’ve worn out the stones in front of your doorstep.’”\n\nThe entire song went from a dream to a demo in just a few short hours — which,\nwhen you listen to “Glasgow,” seems as crazy as the story that led Steenburgen\nto co-write it. “It may sound shallow or like it’s a factory when I talk about\nhow fast we write these things,” Steenburgen said, “but I always think of it\nlike this: ‘I can’t take days to do a scene.’ I can’t say ‘I don’t know what\nthe emotion is for the character, so can you give me until tomorrow?’ I’m\nalways having to tell stories on a time limit.” Steenburgen has only found one\ndrawback to collaborating with Smith and York: “They’re such good singers that\npeople are going to get intimidated by their demos and go, ‘Well I can’t sing\nlike that, so I’m not doing that song.’”\n\n“Wild Rose”\n\n1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right\n\nBuckley, who hadn’t sung in a long time before the production, worried about\ndoing justice to a song like “Glasgow,” especially given that she had no\nbackground in country music. “But the story of it really moved me,” she said,\n“so I sat down with a guitarist in a room and sang it really badly and just\ntried to attach some emotional feeling to it before we started filming.”\n\nBy the time Buckley learned who had written the song, she was only half-\nsurprised: “It made sense, because it clearly came from someone with a complex\nunderstanding of character — someone who was able to kind of go right to the\nroot of what this woman’s story is about, and managed to write lyrics that\nexposed the cracks under the surface,” she said.\n\nWhile Buckley own story feels something like a fairy tale come true, she drew\na distinction with her character. “I told her my secrets and she told me hers\nand we built a different person together,” she said. “‘Glasgow’ is a song of\nbelonging. It’s about stretching yourself to places that you don’t know are\nwithin yourself.” For the first time in a long time, Buckley had something to\nsing about. “This song was such a gift to me,” she said. In turn, it also\nbecame her gift to the women who wrote it.\n\nSteenburgen called Buckley’s performance “stunning,” but seemed changed by the\nexperience in a fundamentally different way than everyone else involved.\n“Music is in my genes thanks to the women in my family, and I just think I was\nsomehow granted access to it,” she said. “It was so overwhelming for me in the\nbeginning because I didn’t grow up with having that voice in my head, like\nKate and Caitlyn did.”\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYFychRzTww>\n\nThe barnstormer of a song that Rose-Lynn performs in the film’s last scene\nconveys the ache and discovery of her journey from prison to paradise. It\nbegins with Buckley’s voice cresting through an ocean of silence, as Rose-Lynn\nsummons the strength to confront her regrets until they resolve into love. She\napologizes to her family, her children, and the entire life she tried to\nescape: “I pushed you away, put a pin in a map, then I got lost in the storm.”\n\nA faint lilt begins to hum behind her, peeking through the lyrics like the\nfirst ray of sunshine after a squall: It’s an accordion, lighting Rose-Lynn’s\nway towards a place she never could have imagined before. “Had to find my own\nway, make my own mistakes, but you know that I had to go,” she sings. “Ain’t\nno yellow brick road running through Glasgow, but I found one that’s stronger\nthan stone.”\n\nAnd then Rose-Lynn hits the chorus with the sweet relief of someone who’s\ntunneled their way to freedom, as Buckley’s voice swells from low to high and\nback again. She sings on behalf of anyone who’s ever had to learn about\nthemselves the hard way: “Ain’t no place like home,” she and Rose-Lynn sing\ntogether, and as the song becomes so big that it envelopes them both, along\nwith all the Glaswegian extras who packed into Celtic Connections for the\n12-hour shoot, and everyone in the audience. It’s staggering.\n\nIt’s also not the happy ending that Rose-Lynn imagined for herself. And yet,\nhappiness often looks different from how you saw it in your head. When\nSteenburgen’s life took an unexpected detour, it felt like fate (or a weird\nquirk of anatomy) was forcing her to choose between the dream she’d had since\nshe was just a starry-eyed girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the strange new\nreality that had ambushed her in a hospital one night. To hear it from her\nnow, it sounds like she’s found a beautiful harmony between the two.\n\n“I didn’t fall out of love with acting when this happened,” Steenburgen said,\n“and I still haven’t. But there’s so much more capability in our brains than\nwe probably realize, and agreeing to diminishment and shutting down doors is a\nchoice that we all make for ourselves. It turns out you don’t really have to\ndo that.”\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-l-Ly0ly4M>\n\n_“Wild Rose” is now available on DVD and VOD._\n\n",

The state’s new slogan for an\nanti-drug campaign drew a South Dakota-sized share of attention on social\nmedia Monday.\n\nJust what is this priceless slogan?\n\n“Meth. We’re on it.”\n\nYes, that’s it. No joke. The governor of South Dakota would like us to know\nthat her state is on meth. You know, like solving the problem. On it!\n\nOf course, you might just be able to see the issue here, besides the fact that\nFlorida Man will have to up the ante next time.\n\nAnd if you haven’t yet noticed what might be wrong, a whole lot of people on\nTwitter pointed it out.\n\nSo many people were talking about South Dakota’s odd new slogan that the state\nand “We’re On It\" became top Twitter trends.\n\nAccording to a report in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, Gov. Kristi Noem\nlaunched the campaign on Monday in an effort to address the state’s meth\ncrisis.\n\n“Meth. We’re on it” is rolling out with TV commercials and billboards in which\npeople say, “I’m on meth.”\n\nThe report says the Minneapolis ad agency Broadhead Co. came up with the\ncampaign, and the state has paid the agency nearly $449,000 so far this year.\n\nNoem saw the Twitter reaction and ... doubled down on the slogan.\n\n“Hey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness,” Noem\ntweeted. “So I think that’s working.”\n\nShe proceeded to share the hashtag #MethWeAreOnIt and onmeth.com, the website\nfor the initiative, which contains the following statement:\n\n“South Dakota has a problem. There isn’t a single solution because meth is\nwidespread. But we can approach it from different angles, so it doesn’t take\nover counties, towns, neighborhoods. Let’s work together. Meth. We’re on it.”\n\nStill, this isn’t the first time a slogan has gone awry in South Dakota.\n\nConsider this 2014 entry — “Don’t jerk and drive,\" meant to discourage drivers\nfrom jerking the wheels of their cars while traveling on icy roads.\n\nThe road safety slogan was an intentional play for a double entendre, but drew\nenough criticism to get the ax from the state Department of Public Safety.\n\nHave a tip?

        "articleBody": "This post may contain affiliate or referral links. Please see our full\naffiliate disclosure here.\n\nThis holiday season I was thinking of flavors that would put me in the holiday\nspirit when it came to me. Not to be confused with a 1990s grunge band, pear\njam is a delicious gift to give for the holidays. With notes of cinnamon,\nnutmeg, ginger, and clove, this **honey pear jam** recipe will have you\nspreading Yuletide cheer in no time! It’s so easy and delicious that you’ll\nwant to make some extra for yourself!\n\nIs there anything better than a piece of toast or a biscuit topped with a\ndollop of jam? Especially _homemade jam_. Not many things are more homey and\ncomforting than jam that has been made in someone’s kitchen. Up until not too\nlong ago, I used to think that people who made their own jam must be wizards.\nJam has always seemed like one of those things that only other people made,\nand then I tried it. Honestly, it’s so easy that anyone can do it with a few\nsimple ingredients and not much equipment.\n\n### Related post: Pickled Brussels Sprouts Recipe\n\n\n\n## WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE JAM\n\nDo you make jam in a pot? A pressure canner? I don’t know. Help!\n\nThe simple answer is that foods with low acidity need to be canned in a\npressure canner. For this jam, though, all you need is an inexpensive water\nbath canner with a rack. A water bath canner is really just a big porcelain\nstockpot that will hold about ten canning jars depending on their size. They\nalso come with a rack that makes removing your jars easier and keeps them from\ncoming in contact with the bottom of the canner.\n\nIn addition to the canner pot, you will need some mason jars (I prefer 8-ounce\njelly jars), a ladle, and something to remove the hot jars from boiling water.\nYou could get creative or just use a jar lifter which is a nifty set of tongs\nmade specifically to fit over mason jars.\n\n\n\n## MAKING SPICED HONEY PEAR JAM\n\nNow that you have your equipment, you will need the ingredients. About 8 ripe\npears, a fresh lemon, fruit pectin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves,\nand a 16-ounce Don Victor® Orange Blossom Comb Honey Globe Jar. Before getting\nyour jam mixture ready, fill your canner to the line on the inside and set it\nto simmer. Add your jelly jars and let them get warm while you make your jam.\n\nCube and peel the pears with a paring knife and put them in a large pot. To\nthe pears, add the juice of one lemon and spices. Stir together and taste test\nit to make sure your flavors are where you want them to be before adding the\nfruit pectin powder. Heat to boiling for a minute or so to combine the spices\nand pears, then add a jar Don Victor® Honey, or about a cup and a half. Let\nthe mixture boil until thickened on the back of a spoon, or about 5-8 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n## HOW TO USE A WATER BATH CANNER\n\nWhen your jam mixture is the correct consistency, use a ladle to transfer the\nmixture into the warm and sterilized jelly jars. I may or may not have been\ngoing a little too fast and spilled some hot jam on my hand. I don’t recommend\nthat, so please pour slowly and carefully.\n\nNow that your jars are filled, put the tops on, lower the rack into the\ncanner, and use your jar lifter to lower the jars into the water one at a\ntime. Turn the stove up from simmering to boil the jars for *10 minutes. If\nyou live at an altitude of more than 1000 feet as I do, you will need to\nadjust your boiling time. There are altitude charts available online. We are\nat 5280 feet in Denver so I boiled mine for 20 minutes.\n\nRemove the jars from the boiling water and let them cool for several hours. If\nyour jam looks runny, don’t worry. It will thicken as it cools. It could take\n24-48 hours to really look like jam.\n\n\n\n\n\n## GIVING THE GIFT OF HOMEMADE JAM\n\nIf you choose to gift your honey pear jam to friends and family, there are so\nmany ways you can present your gift. Make cute labels, put it in a gift\nbasket, or add a piece of fabric and a ribbon to dress up the jar and pass\nthem out to your friends and family. No matter how you choose to present your\ngift, it’s sure to be a winner.\n\nDecorating the top of your jelly jars with fabric is super simple. Cut a piece\nof fabric in a circle to use as a cover for your jelly jars and fasten with a\nribbon to make them extra festive. Set them aside in a pretty basket if you\nwish, ready to hand out to your friends, family, and coworkers.\n\n\n\n## USING HONEY INSTEAD OF SUGAR\n\nI like to use honey because it has more flavor than sugar. In general, when\nsubstituting honey for sugar in a recipe you will use about half the amount.\nFor instance, the original recipe for this jam called for three cups of sugar,\nbut I only use a cup and a half of honey.\n\nBoth the pear jam and honey are a delicious addition to toast, biscuits, or\nhomemade vanilla scones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* 8-9 ripe pears, cored and peeled\n\n* 1 lemon, or about 1/4 cup lemon juice\n\n* 6 tbsp fruit pectin powder\n\n* 1 tsp cinnamon\n\n* 1 tsp nutmeg\n\n* 1 tsp ground ginger\n\n* 1/2 tsp ground cloves\n\n* 1 jar Don Victor® Honey, or 1 1/2 cups\n\n### Instructions\n\n* Fill canner with water and set it to simmer. Add empty jelly jars to sterilize and warm.\n\n* Core, peel, and cube the pears and put them in a pot. Add the juice of one lemon, spices, and fruit pectin. Boil while stirring frequently for about a minute\n\n* Add 1 1/2 cups Don Victor® Honey and boil until thickened enough to stick to the spoon.\n\n* Spoon jam mixture into jelly jars, put the top on, and put them in a water bath canner, increasing the heat to a easy boil.\n\n* Boil for *10 minutes (if over 1000 feet, adjust for altitude)\n\n* Remove from canner and allow to cool. Jam will set within 24-48 hours.\n\n\n\n### You may also like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a Sponsored post written by me on behalf of Netflix.

        "articleBody": "\n\n**Washington, DC, United States –** Getting to the moon, while not easy, has\nbeen done. Staying on the moon and reaching Mars, however, haven not. Why?\nBecause space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\n\nIt is for that reason that the United States‘s space agency NASA on Monday\nenlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space\nindustry’s upstarts – Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s\nSpaceX among them – to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon\nshot.\n\n“We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had\nenhanced lander capabilities,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator\nfor exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference\ncall with media.\n\n“This is based on our objectives, the agency’s objectives, to get to the moon\nas soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human\nexploration standpoint,” he said.\n\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for\ncontracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments,\nand to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the\nspace agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next\nyear, only two committed to that timeline.\n\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA’s Office of the\nInspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted\n“technical challenges, cost increases and schedule delays“. The report and\nMonday’s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency’s 2020\nbudget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even\nfeasible.\n\nIn May, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was\nnecessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to\nMars. Today that mission scope may well have expanded to Jupiter’s moon\nEuropa, as NASA’s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water\nvapour above that moon’s icy crust.\n\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential\ningredients for life – chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water –\nare on Europa.\n\nCloser to home, NASA’s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of\neligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth’s moon, increased\nthe total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions – Blue\nOrigin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX – are notable for not having been\non last year’s original list.\n\n“We’re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that\nare taking us back to the moon. And we are going,” said Brent Sherwood, vice\npresident of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. “It’s very exciting\ntimes. We’re using our Blue moon lander, which is [a] big one.”\n\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted\nto expand their services to include passengers.\n\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two\nrelatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics Inc and Tyvak Nano-Satellite\nSystems Inc, for indefinite delivery – indefinite quantity services with a\ncombined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\n“Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires\nan entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,” said Michael Sims, CEO and\nfounder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\n“There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX\nand Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players.\nAnd we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity\nthat adds to the mix.”\n\nSource: Al Jazeera\n\n",

Wait,\nwhat?\n\nThe drama began earlier this year when Braun’s Ithaca Holdings purchased Big\nMachine for $300M in a deal backed by The Carlyle Group. Carlyle, which\nalready held a stake in Ithaca, is part of a growing number of PE shops\ngetting involved in the music industry.\n\nWhy? Because, capitalism, of course. You see, owning music catalogs has become\nan incredibly lucrative business with the rise in streaming services. *Sharks\nbegin circling*\n\n**Back to Taylor! It’s her music, so why can’t she sing it?**\n\nIt’s complicated.\n\nAccording to Swift, her former label Big Machine, which owns her masters (aka\noriginal recordings), is preventing her from performing her past hits at the\nAmerican Music Awards and for an upcoming Netflix special.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not uncommon for artists to give up the rights to\ntheir original recordings. What isn't as common is a label not allowing an\nartist to perform their music. Mostly because performing the bangers (in\nSwift's case ... most of her music) benefits the owner and the artist\nfinancially.\n\n**He said, she said**\n\nT-Swift took to Twitter to air her grievances with Big Machine, Braun and The\nCarlyle Group (what a time to be alive), recruiting fans to join her cause ...\nbecause hell hath no fury like a teenaged fangirl scorned. Big Machine has\ndenied Swift’s claims, saying they were “shocking and false.” And Taylor Swift\nfans almost broke Investopedia trying to figure out WTF private equity is.\n\n**The bottom line ...**\n\nTaylor Swift is ready to take her songs back and has indicated that she’ll be\nre-recording her biggest hits. Yep, that's kosher. Which versions play on the\nradio and streaming services will determine how big of a blow will be dealt to\nBig Machine and The Carlyle Group.\n\nMoving forward, Swift has a new record deal in place with Universal Music\nGroup, and The Carlyle Group will be left to wonder: \"what did we do to\ndeserve this?\"\n\n_Why Can’t Taylor Swift Perform Her Own Songs?

        "articleBody": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell sharply on Tuesday on oversupply\nconcerns, while a gauge of stocks across the globe rose for a seventh straight\nsession after large overnight gains in Asia.\n\nThe U.S. benchmark S&P; 500 index was little changed, the blue-chip Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average fell and the Nasdaq rose, all having hit record intraday\nhighs earlier in the session.\n\nTraders cited the lingering uncertainty over whether the United States and\nChina could agree to end a near 1-1/2 year trade war as a reason for stocks to\ndrift and bond prices to go higher.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if\nno deal is reached with Beijing to end the trade war. The next round of\ntariffs is due to start in mid-December.\n\nOil fell after sources told Reuters that Russia is unlikely to agree to cut\nits oil output further at a meeting with fellow exporters next month.\n\nSeparately, Norway’s October oil production beat forecasts and the potential\noversupply, combined with some worries over global demand next year, sent\nprices lower.\n\n“Moreover, Russia also failed to fulfill its agreed cuts in November so far,”\nCommerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 fell 3.38% to $55.12 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at\n$60.73, down 2.74% on the day.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 102.2 points, or\n0.36%, to 27,934.02, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 1.85 points, or 0.06%, to 3,120.18\nand the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 20.72 points, or 0.24%, to 8,570.66.\n\nHopes of a trade truce earlier in the day drove European stocks to a four-year\nhigh and a measure of world stock markets to their highest in nearly two\nyears, but those gains were pared later in the session.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX lost 0.12% while MSCI's gauge of\nstocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.02% eking out its seventh\nstraight session of gains.\n\nEmerging market stocks rose 0.48%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific\nshares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.68% higher, while Japan's Nikkei\nfutures NKc1 lost 0.66%.\n\nLong-dated U.S. Treasury yields slipped as risk appetite weakened.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.786%,\ndown from 1.808% late on Monday.\n\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 29/32 in price to yield 2.252%, from\n2.293% late on Monday.\n\nThe dollar was little changed against a basket of six major currencies. The\ndollar index .DXY rose 0.05%, with the euro EUR= up 0.05% to $1.1075.\n\nWhile the dollar was supported by recent U.S. economic data meeting lowered\nexpectations, the greenback may be in for some weakness, said Juan Perez,\nsenior foreign exchange trader and strategist at Tempus Inc.\n\n“Central banks cannot provide that much to incentivize stocks any higher, thus\nrisk-appetite is muted and the buck may continue to lose based on the fact\nthat the American economy is indeed slower and the Fed’s ability to satisfy\nanyone is in question,” Perez said.\n\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.13% versus the greenback at 108.55 per dollar,\nwhile Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2925, down 0.21% on the day.\n\nSpot gold XAU= added 0.1% to $1,472.19 an ounce.\n\nCopper CMCU3 rose 0.86% to $5,880.00 a tonne.\n\nThree-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3 lost 0.06% to\n$1,737.00 a tonne.\n\n(Graphic: Global assets in 2019 - here)\n\n(Graphic: Global currencies vs. dollar - here)\n\n(Graphic: Emerging markets in 2019 - here)\n\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos; additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly, Saqib\nIqbal Ahmed and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Dan\nGrebler\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big iFixit teardown is done, and the results are in. The new 16-inch\nMacBook Pro is a heck of a lot like the old 15-inch MacBook Pro, save for a\nfew meaningful throwback features. Yes, I mean throwback as in retro—as in\nApple actually took retired features from old MacBooks and reintroduced them\nas new features. It would seem that the future of innovation at the Cupertino-\nbased computer company is what I’ll call rewind design.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m not complaining. The 16-inch MacBook Pro looks like a hell of a laptop, as\nit should for a starting price of $2,400. The new machine comes with a bigger\ndisplay, a bigger battery, better speakers, and a brand new AMD graphics card.\nThen there are those retro features. There’s a physical escape button just\nlike there was on MacBook Pros before the rise of the Touch Bar. The arrow\nkeys are once again arranged in an inverted “T” formation, as they had been on\nkeyboards for decades. The new “Magic Keyboard” uses a scissor switch that’s\nalmost identical to the Bluetooth-enabled Magic Keyboard that Apple released\nnearly five years ago.\n\nThe keyboard thing is a big deal. Apple has been dealing with public outrage\nsparked by its newer butterfly mechanism in MacBook keyboards. This low-travel\ndesign contributed to the impossible thinness of the 12-inch MacBook released\nin 2015, before finding its way into all MacBook models in 2016. Even a small\nbit of dust or debris could disable a key, and fixing it required replacing\nthe entire upper half of the laptop. Apple admitted to the flawed design and\nlaunched a limited repair program in June 2018, before it ultimately offered\nfree keyboard repairs for all MacBooks with the new mechanism. The company was\nstill trying to fix the scissor design as recently as May of this year when it\nlaunched an updated 15-inch MacBook Pro. Now, the cursed butterfly-powered\nMacBook keyboard is all but dead. The new keyboard design is expected to show\nup on smaller MacBooks in early 2020.\n\nBut the new design isn’t all that new. As iFixit points out in its teardown,\nthe 16-inch MacBook’s keyboard is virtually identical to the well-loved Magic\nKeyboard from 2o15. In other words, Apple replaced a flawed design from\n2015—one that it had tried and failed to perfect many times—with a design from\n2015 that wasn’t so flawed. It’s almost as if Apple made the wrong decision\nalmost five years ago, and in order to deal with that, it’s just going back in\ntime and making the right decision. The same is true for the new physical\nescape button, which Apple had axed on most MacBook Pro models in 2016, and\nfor the new inverted “T” arrow key layout, which Apple had done away with back\nin 2015.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission\n\n**All colors on sale today**\n\nGizmodo describes these premium headphones as “annoyingly incredible.\" This is\nthe lowest we've seen the Apple AirPods Max yet.\n\nThis is a curious way to design computers. It also seems like Apple’s MacBook\nteam was really screwing up back in 2015. That was a time when the company’s\ndesign team decided to fix a few things that weren’t broken and break a few\nmore things in the process. Now, to fix those problems, Apple is just\nreplacing the broken new things with near-identical versions of the old\nthings, effectively putting its design process in reverse. If you liked the\ncrispiness and ease of the newer scissor mechanism on the big MacBook Pro, too\nbad. Apple failed at perfecting its promising design so it just switched back\nto the old one.\n\nOnce again, I’m not complaining. As one of the many thousands of people with\nbroken MacBook keyboards, I welcome the return of the more robust design of\nthe Magic Keyboard. I have one of the old Magic Keyboards on my desk, and I\nlove it! I especially love how the keys don’t break constantly. And while\nwe’re on the topic, I also miss having an escape key. My 15-inch MacBook Pro\nhas a Touch Bar, which I hate—although I would hate it slightly less if it had\na physical escape key. I’m honestly impartial on the inverted “T” arrow key\nthing, but I know some people are passionate about it.\n\nWhat does bug me about Apple’s new take on innovation is that it confirms the\nbelief that the company seldom has new ideas. I wrote a long rant about this\nlast year when it was apparent that Apple focuses less on hardware innovation\nand more on money-making services. That prediction, unfortunately, turned out\nto be true. In recent months, we’ve seen the release of a new iPhone, which\namounted to the old iPhone plus an extra camera, as well as the new Apple TV+\nstreaming service, which is a bit bland. They’re not bad products. But they’re\ncertainly not groundbreaking.\n\nThe same appears to be true for the 16-inch MacBook Pro. I’ll reserve final\njudgment until I’ve had time to test the new laptop, and given my penchant for\nan operational keyboard and an escape key, I bet I’ll like it. I just can’t\nstop wondering if I’ll ever see another new Apple product that warps my\nunderstanding of technology the way that the iPod or the iPhone did so many\nyears ago. It’s possible that Apple will do it with some sort of augmented\nreality headset in the next couple of years. Maybe its designers have been so\nbusy working on that futuristic product that they couldn’t focus on perfecting\nkeyboard design. Surely they’ve been busy doing better things.\n\n2\\. Intel has accelerated the death of the laptop with it’s lazy ass saunter\nthrough 14nm+++ land because apparently they forgot how to fabricate chips and\nhave been pumping out the same damn Swan Lake processor for 5 years. Meanwhile\nyou got a A Series chips with 1/10 the power requirements beating Core i5s.\nIt’s hard to innovate when your processor hasn’t changed in half a decade.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "December 24, 2019\n\nAs the year comes to an end, it's time to sit back and reflect. This year we\nsaw Samsung almost fold the Fold, the Motorola Razr make a comeback, and Apple\nimpresses with the iPhone 11's camera. We also saw gadgets from tech\ncompanies, large and small, that made a splash over the past year.\n\nSurely, as we head into the season of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, along\nwith the many promotions we'll see before the holidays arrive, so be sure to\nkeep on an eye out for the best deals.\n\n## Some of 2019's best tech gadgets\n\n**Disclosure** : _ZDNet_ may earn a commission from some of the products\nfeatured on this page.\n\n### Apple AirPods Pro for $235\n\n**See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nSince the AirPods first launched in 2016, users and critics alike have been\nasking for noise cancellation and replaceable tips for a better fit. Apple\nfinally delivered all of that and then some with the new AirPods Pro. The new\ndesign sounds better, will drown out background noise in noisy environments,\nand comes with three different sized tips to ensure you get the right fit.\n\n### Nintendo Switch Lite for $200\n\n**See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nThe smaller, more portable Nintendo Switch gives up the ability to slide into\na dock and game on your TV, but it gains battery life and fun new colors. The\nscreen has been shrunk to 5.5-inches, and the Joy-Cons are permanently\nattached to the device. But outside of that, it's still the same old Switch\nthat users love and embrace.\n\n### Sonos Move for $400\n\n**See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nSonos speakers have long been considered some of the best home entertainment\nspeakers available, but they all had one problem -- they weren't portable.\nWith Sonos Move, the company created a speaker that sounds as good as the rest\nof its lineup, but it's completely portable. You can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or\nApple's AirPlay 2 to stream music through the Move, regardless of how close\nthe nearest power outlet is.\n\n### Amazon Echo Buds for $130\n\n**See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nIn many ways, 2019 was the year of wireless earbuds. Amazon's Echo Buds have\nbeen well received and cost far less than Apple's AirPods Pro. The earbuds\nhave Alexa built-in, have active noise cancellation, and work with iOS and\nAndroid devices.\n\n### Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max for $999\n\n**See it now:** **Apple**\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn't supposed to blow us away, but that's exactly what\nit did. Apple not only caught up with its camera features, but it's done an\namazing job with new features like Night Mode. Then there's the fact that\nbattery life on the 11 Pro Max is simply the best on any phone you can get\nthis year.\n\n### Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus for $840\n\n**See it now:** **Samsung**\n\nArguably the best Android phone of 2019, the Note 10 Plus is well designed,\nhas a long list of features and capabilities, and is powerful enough to keep\nup with whatever you throw at it. It has plenty of cameras to harness your\ncreativity, and, of course, it has that S-Pen that users know and love.\n\n### DJI Mavic Mini for $399\n\n**See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nThe Mavic Mini is the ideal combination of a capable drone in a small package.\nWith a range of up to 4km and battery life of 30 minutes, it's pretty hard to\nbelieve it's priced at $399. It's perfect for those new to drones and\nenthusiasts who love shiny new things.\n\n### Fossil Hybrid HR smartwatch for $195\n\n**See it now:** **Fossil**\n\nThe Fossil Hybrid HR is billed as a smartwatch, but could easily pass as a\nnormal watch. Underneath the physical watch hands is an energy-efficient\ndisplay that sips on battery yet still provides notifications from your\nconnected phone, as well as weather and calendar details.\n\n### Wyze Sense Starter Kit for $20\n\n**See it now:** **Wyze**\n\nKnow when a window or door opens, or whenever there's motion in the hallway\nwith the Wyze Sense starter kit. You'll need one of Wyze's security cameras to\nconnect it all to the internet, but those are just as cheap as this kit.\n\n### Amazon Echo Dot with clock for $45\n\n**See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nOne of my top requests to Amazon's Alexa is to ask for the current time. The\nnew Echo Dot with a clock eliminates that by adding a small digital clock to\nthe side. You can still ask for the time, of course, or use Alexa to control\nconnected devices, ask questions or play music.\n\n### Ring Indoor Cam for $60\n\n**See it now:** **Amazon**\n\nRing security cameras are some of the best, but up until now, they'd all been\nmade primarily for outdoor use. The new indoor camera is affordable and\ncapable of helping you monitor your home.\n\nLet's be honest, distilling down the past year's worth of gadget launches into\na shortlist is hard. Really hard. Surely, we left some of your favorite\ngadgets off of this list. Leave a comment and let us know what your favorite\ngadget of 2019 is.\n\nBest gifts for co-workers under $50 on Amazon\n\n",

The\nprotests began peacefully in June and were sparked by proposed legislation\nthat would have meant criminal suspects could be extradited to the mainland.\nAlthough the bill was withdrawn, the protests had broadened into a resistance\nmovement against the territory’s government and Beijing.\n\n### Related articles\n\nMany of the protesters wear masks to shield their identities for protection.\n\nChina’s ambassador to Britain accused the UK and the US of meddling in the\ncountry’s affairs and warned that the Chinese government “will not sit on our\nhands” if the Hong Kong situation “becomes uncontrollable”.\n\nCheuk Hau-yip, the commander of Kowloon West district, said: “These rioters,\nthey are also criminals. They have to face the consequences of their acts.\n\nChina has warned they will cease control of Hong Kong (Image: GETTY )\n\nThe protests kicked off in June and have strengthened in size (Image: GETTY )\n\n“Other than coming out to surrender, I don’t see that there’s any viable\noption for them.”\n\nChina’s ambassador to Britain Liu Xiaming has said that China has the\n“resolution and power” to end Hong Kong unrest amid protests.\n\nLiu said that the People’s Liberation Army could be deployed in Beijing,\nwarning: “They are already there in the Hong Kong garrison. They are there to\nshow sovereignty and are responsible for defence purposes.\n\n**SEE MORE** : Hong Kong protests: 800 students under siege in university\n\nProtesters do not want Hong Kong to lose its autonomy (Image: getty )\n\n“If the situation becomes uncontrollable, the central government certainly\nwould not sit on our hands and watch. We have enough resolution and power to\nend the unrest.”\n\nThis comes as China has denounced a Hong Kong court ruling declaring the\ngovernment’s mask ban unconstitutional.\n\nThis decision has been seen as “seriously weakening” the power of the Hong\nKong chief executive.\n\nChris Tang, Hong Kong’s new police commissioner, said in an interview that\npolice alone are not able to end the violence.\n\n**DON'T MISS**\n\nChina furious at Macron for Hong Kong protest jibe [ **INSIGHT]|** Lakers vs\nNets: NBA make final decision on game amid China turmoil [\n\nProtesters believe the extradition bill is an example of Hong Kong’s eroding\nautonomy under Beijing.\n\nThey worry China is taking back the freedoms given to Hong Kong when the UK\nreturned the territory to China.\n\nHong Kong police have laid siege to a university, pinning 800 students inside\nand threatened to use live ammunition on them, as the latest round of anti-\ngovernment protests escalates.\n\nThe Hong Kong Protests - how they happened (Image: EXPRESS )\n\nChina said it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula granting\nHong Kong autonomy, while the city’s police deny accusations of brutality and\nsay they show utmost restraint.\n\nThe UK has urged an “end to the violence and for all sides to engage in\nmeaningful political dialogue”.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "If you click on a link and make a purchase we may receive a small commission.\n\nRead our editorial policy\n\nEven if its core components are owed to other games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen\nOrder finds a reason for their inclusion and stops just short of greatness.\n\n**Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order** is game that is many things to different\npeople. You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of\nclimbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan\nyour next jump.\n\nIt’s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking,\ndodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it’s even Star\nWars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally\nancient tombs.\n\nWhere it’s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I\ninstead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other\ngames and presenting them in a coherent way.\n\nFallen Order’s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding\nas a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge\nof the Jedi. The game’s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the\nprequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era’s biggest moments is enough to\nget you on board with the premise.\n\nOne of the narrative’s strongest elements is that it doesn’t rely on iconic\ncharacters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan\nare briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction\ntends to bring to their appearances. There’s one exception to that towards the\nvery end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-\nexecuted, but ultimately doesn't matter to the general story.\n\nAfter hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the\nForce, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly\nadorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them\nuse Greez's ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With\nthe exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time\nto grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in\nbleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year’s best new character.\n\nI have to give special attention to his voice direction - and my god, every\nlittle animation he plays – both of which build up his character as an\ninquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial\nrobots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2’s\nBT-7274.\n\nThe general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to\nobtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find\nsaid civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little\nbearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn't so much\nthe need to get the _things_ , as it was to spend more time with these\nincredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways.\nTaking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will\nonly be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes\nrequire a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.\n\nThis means you’ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets\neven as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn’t shy about\nsending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the\nnext, but you don’t always need to follow the quest marker if you don’t want\nto.\n\nI visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just\nby exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that\nenemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I\nmanaged to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different\npoint through normal story progression, so it’s great to see Respawn offer\nplayers the freedom to obtain it so early.\n\nAs more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated\nmess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It’s not as elegant as you might\nfind in FromSoftware’s work, which is what makes the map – available to you at\nany point – such a lifesaver.\n\nThe map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible\nand which aren’t. They’re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked\noff require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It’s\na more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake’s map, and alleviates\nsome of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous\nlevels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems\nentirely, but one doesn’t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend\nminutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and\nwatch a cutscene.\n\nIn your adventures, you’ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The\nwildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they’re often in groups, and\nhave harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in\na single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a\nbigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers,\nhowever - units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.\n\nThose not only offer the biggest challenge, they’re mostly armed with melee\nweapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more\nmanageable.\n\n\n\n_The best new character in 2019._\n\nFallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three\ntogether, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these\nsort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.\n\nYou’re going to parry the basic trooper’s bolts back at them, killing them in\none hit. You’ll watch for the melee trooper’s very obvious tells to also get\nrid of them very quickly, and you’ll use whatever Force powers you might have\nto push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the\ncrowd. After all is said and done, you’ll be left with one or two Purge\nTroopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious.\n\nI understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out\nthe power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on\nMaster), you’re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as\nyou would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone\nplaying The Force Unleashed 2019.\n\nA better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the\nlower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would\nlove to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to\nget stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.\n\nFallen Order’s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its\nown rules. You don’t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy\nessentially forever, although most enemies can block.\n\nYou and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are\nblocked. After it depletes, you'll need to disengage until it recharges, or go\non the offensive. It’s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-\nstepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where\nit falters is the execution.\n\nEnemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through\nyour roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you’ll begin defaulting to\njust holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable,\nbut it’s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll\nthrough and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some\nconsistency is required when fighting regular enemies.\n\nAnother problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time\nit right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a\nfight. There’s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you\npull one off. Your opponents’ guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment\nas a result of the parry.\n\nFallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into\nthe blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can’t cancel into a parry.\nThis caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing\nright. By the same token, enemies don’t really care about your parries, save\nfor bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They’ll often continue their combo unabated\nand you’ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren’t\nworking.\n\nOver time, I realised that the animation simply isn’t fast enough to keep up\nwith enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and\nblocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I\nfound that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often\neasier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that\nwindow to attack.\n\nThese little inconsistencies add up, and could’ve soured me on the game if\nForce powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn’t hook me.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in\ntraversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the\nlimited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the\naforementioned combat could all – at the game’s worst moments – lead to\nfrustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those\nedges, and it may get there eventually - but right now, lack of polish is\nholding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren’t enough to knock down my\nenjoyment, and I’ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to\nplayers on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident,\nfocused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don’t always win.\n\nThe action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired\nby, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting – but\nRespawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside\nthose hallowed inspirations.\n\nAnd yes, it doesn't always get there in this one, but damn If I can’t help but\nrespect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are\nserviceable, and best moments are memorable. It’s worth experiencing by Star\nWars fans hungry for an original story that doesn’t settle for trite, and\naction game players looking for a decent - albeit flawed – combat.\n\n_Version tested: PC._\n\n",

        "articleBody": "The equity benchmark Sensex scaled a new all-time high of 40,816.38 in the\nmorning trade on November 20. Not just the Sensex, even the Nifty has been\nrallying at a time when concerns over the Indian economy are growing, with\nmacroeconomic data pointing to a slowdown.\n\nWhy is the market behaving differently from the economy?\n\n\"Markets usually run ahead of macros and price future growth. There are three\npositive indicators for growth – reduction in the corporate tax rate, proposed\ndivestment of large public sector units and a possible resolution of the US-\nChina trade impasse. Therefore, we see growth coming back in 2020. Now, we\nexpect broader markets to outperform,\" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director, IIFL\nSecurities.\n\nExperts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a\nrecovery in the economy.\n\n\"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a\nreasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak\nInstitutional Equities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings.\n\nThe September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of\nthe companies reported in-line or better than expected results.\n\nTax cuts have positively impacted the earnings in the higher tax bracket. The\nkey positive from the Q2 results season is that even on the operational front\n(sales and EBITDA), the misses did not exceed the beats and were largely\nneutral, say experts.\n\n\"The hope of a faster recovery in earnings because of a cut in the corporate\ntax is keeping the market higher,\" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental\nResearch at Kotak Securities.\n\nFor the last few months, the government has been active in addressing the\nconcerns about the economy. This is also supporting the sentiment, Oza said.\n\nBank and financial stocks are among the major contributors to the gains. Oza\nattributed the rally in bank stocks to the Supreme Court's ruling on the Essar\nSteel resolution.\n\n\"The Essar Steel case verdict is a big positive for banks. This verdict should\nbe seen in a broader view, as now bidders will be much more comfortable in\nbidding and banks will have this belief that the probability of recovery will\nbe high now,\" said Oza.\n\nGlobal financial firm JP Morgan had called the Supreme Court decision on the\nEssar Steel resolution a landmark judgment. Nomura said the order favoured\nbanks and identified SBI and ICICI Bank as its key beneficiaries. **Near-term\nconsolidation likely**\n\nHungarian-American investor George Soros had said, \"Stock market bubbles don't\ngrow out of thin air. They have a solid basis in reality, but reality as\ndistorted by a misconception.\"\n\nThe hopes of recovery in the economy and optimism around corporate earnings\nshould not turn into misplaced optimism, experts say.\n\n\"We remain sceptical of a quick recovery in the Indian economy given several\nstructural issues, the limited fiscal capacity to support consumption or\ninvestment demand and inefficacy of policy rate cuts given crowding out by the\nhigh government borrowings,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities.\n\nAn extended slowdown could result in the market losing hope of an imminent\nrevival in demand supported by government action, the brokerage said.\n\nComing back to the market, experts say the upside will be capped for the\nmarket and some consolidation is likely in the near-term.\n\nPankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, pointed out that this is\na stock-specific market. Midcaps and smallcaps are underperforming the\nbenchmark.\"It is a stock-specific market so not expecting a broad-based rally.\nSo far, it looks fair as it is following the directional cues,\" he said.\n\nThe valuation of the market is also a point that experts highlight.\n\nThe Indian market’s high valuations are being supported by a combination of\nfactors, including low global and domestic bond yields, expectations of a\nChina-US trade deal, expectations of further reforms in India and Street's\nexpectations of a strong earnings recovery over FY2020-22.\n\n\"We see risks to all these points and thus, any negative changes to the\nmarket’s expectations, especially related to further reforms in India and\nstrong earnings recovery, could disappoint the market,\" Kotak Institutional\nEquities said. _Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by\ninvestment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the\nwebsite or its management.

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_AppleInsider is supported by its audience and may earn commission as an\nAmazon Associate and affiliate partner on qualifying purchases. These\naffiliate partnerships do not influence our editorial content._\n\nWelcome to the new 16-inch MacBook Pro. While it looks quite familiar, Apple's\nnew flagship laptop moves the needle forward in a big way. We've spent the\nlast several days taking the new Pro for a spin and can say that Apple has\ndutifully listened to users' feedback this time around. Let's talk about it.\n\nWe're not certain when Apple last issued four updates to the MacBook Pro\nwithin 18 months, or to any laptop it has ever produced. But, here we are.\n\nJust months after the last i9 MacBook Pro was released, Apple has unveiled its\n16-inch MacBook Pro. The surface changes aren't even obvious — the monitor is\nabout a half an inch larger on the diagonal, and you can't even tell that the\nmachine is larger than the 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro design.\n\nInterestingly, it is actually smaller and thinner than the 2012 through 2015\nmodel. You also can't tell unless you're looking at the three together.\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/embed/NgbF86kNLgs>\n\n_Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTube_\n\nThere are three main configurations of the 15-inch MacBook Pro, one with a\n2.6GHz Intel Core i7 processor, a 2.3GHz i9 model, and a 2.4GHz i9\nconfiguration — effectively the same options as the 15-inch MacBook Pro from\nearlier in 2019. Depending on model, there are options for a AMD Radeon Pro\n5300M or 5500M. For this review, we're examining the 2.4GHz 16-inch MacBook\nPro, with 512GB of flash storage, 32GB of RAM, and the Radeon Pro 5500M. The\nretail price on this configuration is $3,299.\n\n## 16-inches instead of 15.4\n\nThis will matter to you a great deal, or it won't, and even before you started\nreading this, you already knew if it mattered to you or not. In our eyes,\nthere are more important aspects to the 16-inch MacBook Pro redesign than the\nscreen, though.\n\nWhat we will say, is if you are staring at a 15-inch MacBook Pro right next to\nthe 16-inch MacBook Pro you will notice a difference. The updated design looks\nbetter with slimmer bezels and an ever-so-slightly elevated pixel density\ngoing from 220 to 226ppi. That likely won't be a huge reason for users to\nupgrade though.\n\n\n\nThe slimmer bezels of the 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\nPros out there who are well-versed in the video space will appreciate one\nchange to the display though, which is the ability to specifically choose your\nrefresh rate. Heading to System Preferences, multiple options can be chosen\nfrom to best align with your work.\n\n## Keyboard\n\nKeyboards are highly subjective. So highly subjective, in fact, that even if\nyou like a mechanical keyboard, there are dozens of different iterations, with\ndifferent key feels because assorted manufacturers believe that there is that\nmuch granularity in demand.\n\nSo, a little context is important. We're not giant fans of typing on glass,\nlike the iPad. We didn't have a problem with the butterfly keyboard that was\nintroduced with the 2016 MacBook Pro — but it wasn't a favorite of ours.\n\n\n\nInverted 'T' design for arrow keys\n\nWe get that the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard design, and iterations, are\npolarizing. Where the 2012 through 2015 design had the entire expression of\nkeyboard like and hate, the 2016 through 2019 weighed more heavily on the\n\"it'll do\" to \"this is terrible\" range, with very, very few folks in the \"this\nis great\" zone.\n\nIn regards to reliability, across the entire _AppleInsider_ staff, exactly one\nunit had to be replaced. We had the same failure rate with the 2012 through\n2015 keyboard. And, the data we've been collecting on the 2018 model and the\nmid-2019 refresh suggests that whatever Apple did for reliability is working,\nwith it having an equivalent failure rate in the first year to the 2012\nthrough 2015 design.\n\nBeyond looking back, the key actuation on the 16-inch MacBook Pro is\npunctuated by a soft click, most similar to the mid-2019 noise versus any\nother, if a bit quieter. Where the 2015 design noise was more from the key\nbottoming out the switch, if you press slowly, you can feel where the click is\non the new computer, before hitting the bottom of the chamber. Gone is the\nclackety-clack of the original 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard, and you'll never\nmistake this keyboard for a desktop mechanical model.\n\nThere's more sensory data on the keys in the video that accompanies this\npiece. But, here are the numbers: the key travel on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\nkeyboard is one millimeter. This is in comparison to between 0.6 and 0.7\nmillimeters on the 2016-style keyboard, and between 1.2 and 1.5 millimeters on\nthe 2012 through 2015 style.\n\n\n\nTyping on the new MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard\n\nIn our testing, we had a baseline of 38 dBa of ambient noise measured with a\nKanomax model 4431 audiometer, with the test gear at head height and distance.\nTyping on the 2016 MacBook Pro with no other CPU load brought that up to about\n43 dBa. The highest we could manage on the 16-inch MacBook pro with a\nparticularly angry bout of random key-mashing was 41 dBa. Quieter indeed.\n\nWith that 2016 redesign, Apple made a big deal about key stability being an\nunderpinning of the design. In short, the new keyboard is more key travel than\nthe 2016, but less than the 2012. Whatever Apple did for key stability in the\n2016 was moved to the 16-inch MacBook pro — and this is a good thing.\n\nAnd, Apple tells us that individual keys can be replaced. We didn't get any\ninformation on what this entails, but at this juncture, it still looks like a\ncomplete disassembly is required to do so.\n\n## Touch Bar and Escape Key\n\nThe new keyboard on the 16-inch MacBook Pro has a physical escape key, and\ninstead of the Touch ID sensor being connected to the Touch Bar, it is in its\nown little well. Coders have been clamoring for the former, and we think that\nApple did the latter to ease repair, if that sensor needs to be replaced.\n\n\n\nIn our use, a physical escape key makes little difference — but for coders,\nit's an entirely different story. We've been told about times where things\nhave gone completely awry, and the virtual escape key on the Touch Bar doesn't\nwork at all, forcing a hard reboot.\n\nAs a general rule, we like what the Touch Bar brings. After a lukewarm initial\nimpression. we've adopted it into our workflows. We're not going to say that\neverybody is going to like it, but utilities like Better Touch Tool open up a\nfrontier of customization options, and we recommend it to anybody that has a\nTouch Bar and wants to use it beyond the Apple-sanctioned or developer-\nmandated uses.\n\n## Testing the silicon\n\nApple did include the same CPU options as the mid-2019 predecessors but thanks\nto its new internals, it is able to get slightly better performance out of the\nchips. When we compared the 16-inch base to the previous 15-inch base, we saw\nthat single-core scores increased from 1061 to 1128 and multi-core scores\nincreased from 5425 to 5641 on Geekbench 5.\n\nIn Cinebench R20, scores jumped as well from 2395 to 2623. This is due to the\nmachine being able to keep those cores cooler for longer.\n\nRunning the Browserbench.org Speedometer test that measures web app\nperformance on each machine, the new machine scored a 129 while the previous\ngeneration clocked in at a 126.8.\n\n## GPU\n\nFor the GPU, we turned once more to our usual Unigine Heaven benchmark.\nRunning at full screen, with tesselation and stereo turned off, at medium\nquality (our standard settings), the new machine earned an average of 86.6\nframes per second and a 2182 score. It maxed out at an impressive 162.1 frames\nper second.\n\n\n\nUnigine Heaven benchmark results for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\nImpressively, that beats the VEGA 20 graphics from the previous design which\nearned a total score of 2072 and a max FPS of 147.4. It also won on average\nFPS over the previous 82.3. Again, that is our base model compared to the\nprevious high-end selection.\n\nIn another benchmark to test the performance of Metal, we ran the Geekbench 5\nCompute test. The new base machine managed a 21757 while the previous base\ngarnered only a 13919.\n\nLastly, we performed an export test. Exporting the same 4K 24FPS Final Cut Pro\nX project from both base units with the same settings. Final Cut was updated\nThe previous generation took 4 minutes and 15 seconds while the updated\nmachine did the export in only 2 minutes and 38 seconds.\n\n## Thermals\n\nThe 2018 15-inch i9 MacBook Pro was a very hot machine. While it still holds\nup, Apple has improved the situation greatly with the 16-inch MacBook pro.\n\nEight cores are hot. The 5500M chipset is toasty, and the RAM is too.\n\nIn our use, when the 2018 i9 MacBook Pro was under load, the keyboard's metal\nsurface routinely hit 107 degrees Fahrenheit around the G, H, and J keys.\nThat's still usable, but it is very, very warm. On the new 16-inch MacBook\nPro, that area is still the hotspot, but it hit a maximum of 89 degrees while\nrunning under load.\n\nThere are still a large number of picky details to examine with the 16-inch\nMacBook Pro in regards to the thermal environment. We'll be looking a lot more\nat varying work environments including ambient temperature effects, and\nmachine orientations as the weeks and months wear on to see if they make any\ndifference at all to performance.\n\nBut, we're not expecting to see much difference this time around.\n\nIn regards to the revamped cooling system. Apple says that the 16-inch MacBook\nPro has different fan blades and more surface area on all heat exchanging\nsurfaces. This means that the computer sounds different under load.\n\nStrictly from a noise standpoint, in the same 38 dBA room, the 2016 MacBook\nPro under heavy load is about 45 dBa at the same range that we did the\nkeyboard testing. The 16-inch MacBook Pro hit a maximum of 44 dBa, with\nequivalent fan speeds to the 2016 model.\n\nThe MacBook Pro for the last seven years has sounded about the same. It's hard\nto describe how it sounds now, but there's a lower pitch and a different\nwarble to the fans now, likely because of the new blade shape. You'll notice\nthe difference if you're a long-time user, but it isn't distracting, and\nyou'll forget the old sound pretty quickly.\n\n\n\nUsing Final Cut Pro X on the new MacBook Pro\n\nWe've only just started testing and thermal performance. Our initial testing\nsuggests that the 16-inch MacBook Pro can maintain a higher clock speed for\nlonger — which isn't well-reflected in benchmark testing to date.\n\nThe fans on the new MacBook Pro start to get audible in that 38 dBa office\nenvironment at about 83 degrees Celsius processor temperature. Based on\nobservation, they start to pick up speed at about 75C — earlier than the 80C\nthat the 2016 through 2019 MacBook Pro start to ramp up. We'll be testing this\nmore in the future.\n\nThe efficacy of this thermal redesign in regards to your own workflow will\nvary very much depending on your individual workload. But, using a utility\nthat turns off the boost feature on the processor essentially guarantees a\nsilent machine with next to no fan noise, at a cost of taking about one and a\nhalf times longer to complete your job. We'll be talking about this in the\nfuture too.\n\n## Flash speeds are still blistering\n\nThe drive is absolutely no slouch. Running the BlackMagic disk speed test\nafter the machine had been indexing for two days, we saw a write speed of 2890\nmegabytes per second, and a read speed of 3150 megabytes per second on both a\n512GB and 1TB model.\n\nThis is a bit faster than the i9 MacBook Pro from earlier in 2019, and about\n350MB per second faster than the 2018 MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage or\nmore.\n\n## Battery life\n\n\n\nBattery is improved on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\nThis time Apple baked in a new 100Wh battery that is necessary for the beefed-\nup internals. That new battery doesn't just match the last model's\nperformance, it extends it. While we didn't have too much of a chance to surf\nthe web for 11 hours on end, Apple says that is what you can expect — which is\none hour more than the 15-inch offered.\n\n## Speakers\n\nWe didn't expect much change when it came to speakers, but after trying them\nout we were wowed.\n\nMoving between listening to our above test playlist reserved for speakers and\nheadphones as well as Apple TV+ content with Dolby Atmos, it makes listening\nto content on a portable machine far more enjoyable.\n\n\n\nThere are six speakers in the new MacBook Pro\n\nBass was substantial, but thanks to the dual force-canceling drivers, it\ndoesn't cause the machine to shake or feel uncomfortable at loud volumes.\n\nThe biggest note was how much larger and fuller the soundstage appeared as we\nlistening to content from one machine to the other.\n\n## Wi-Fi 6\n\nOddly, Apple has a few omissions with the pro machine. The FaceTime camera is\nstill capped at a meager 720p. But more frustrating, Apple has felt the need\nto hold back with 801.11ac Wi-Fi rather than jump to Wi-Fi 6 ax as we saw with\nthe most recent iPhone launch.\n\nConsidering a Mac is intended to be a portable machine, the lack of the latest\nWi-Fi tech is frustrating. Users rightly expect to pick up a Mac and use it\nfor several years and investing in a new machine shouldn't be capped by\nprevious standards. Especially one Apple has already adopted en masse with\nmillions of iPhones.\n\nWi-Fi 6 is still launching and there is only a smattering of ax routers on the\nmarket so looking at today's landscape users aren't missing out, but they will\nwhen they have this machine in two-three years and Wi-Fi 6 has been more\nwidely adopted.\n\nThere will certainly be some iPhone 11 Pro users who will jump on board with\nWi-Fi 6 early to take advantage of it on their phones that will be left behind\nwith the new MacBook Pro in that regard.\n\n## Still four Thunderbolt 3\n\nApple has now redesigned the MacBook Pro, listening to pro users, and the HDMI\nport has not returned. Thunderbolt 3 is staying. It's past time to come to\nterms and deal with it.\n\n\n\nStill four Thunderbolt 3 ports\n\nThe USB-C physical connector on Thunderbolt 3 is not the end of the world, but\nit is an adjustment for users, if you're coming from a 2015 or older MacBook\nPro. Complaints that there are multiple flavors of USB-C are correct, but this\nis more of an issue with cable labeling than anything else. That adjustment is\nbetter made, than tolerated using half-baked solutions.\n\nWe've said this before, many times: there is no special hardware required to\nconnect a HDMI or DVI monitor. Given that the Thunderbolt 3 protocol\nexplicitly contains the HDMI protocol, a cable will do, or a dongle if you\nprefer. There is no breakout box needed for USB-A connectors, and a peripheral\ncable or dongle there can be had too, depending on what you need.\n\nFortunately, since you have Thunderbolt 3, and not the other varieties of\nUSB-C, cables are cheap, and plentiful. You _can_ get there from here, and it\nisn't expensive to do so.\n\n\n\n16-inch MacBook Pro\n\nLike we've been saying for nearly four years now, if you're hell-bent on\nsticking with your existing cabling instead of adopting cables with a USB-C\nend is choosing from one of many a Thunderbolt dock. Thunderbolt 3 docks start\nat $199 retail, and USB 3.2 type C ones can be had for cheaper than that, if\nyou don't need the full 40 gigabits per second that the faster protocol\nallows.\n\nIn our testing, with a two-hour load on the MacBook Pro using both the CPU and\nGPU, an 87W Thunderbolt 3 dock or power adapter still drained the battery to\nthe tune of about 4% per hour. Under \"normal\" office use or similar work there\nwas no drain at all.\n\nIf you have an older Thunderbolt dock from your 2012 or later Retina MacBook\nPro, the $49 Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter will connect that\nunit to the new machine. It won't supply power, but, fortunately, the 96W\nadapter that your machine came with will.\n\nFurthermore, if you're considering an external GPU, many of the enclosures\nhave USB-A and Ethernet ports, in an accessory that costs not much more than a\ndock does. If all you need are a few USB-A ports, get a USB 3.0 dock, along\nwith a USB-C to USB-B cable for around $8. Problem solved. Nothing that we've\nseen presently for eGPU enclosures provides 96W, but that will likely be\nrectified very soon.\n\nRegarding MagSafe, we've been testing USB-C for a very, very long time at this\npoint, and our results are unchanged. On a melamine, Corian, or finished wood\ndesk surface, the force required to pull out Apple's USB-C charging cable is\nabout three-quarters of what it takes to break a MagSafe 2 connection, when\nthe cable is pulled from less than a 40-degree angle from center on the\nhorizontal plane, and less than 30 degrees from center on the vertical.\n\n\n\nThe 96W USB-C power adapter\n\nAnd, the AC adapter also has a USB-C connector with the same disconnect force,\nso now there are two rapid breakpoints in the case of an accident or\ninadvertent pull.\n\nApple's service numbers that we've collated bear out that the removal of\nofficial MagSafe hasn't caused any notable increase in incidents. MagSafe's\nintroduction in January 2006 halved accidental damage service calls by 2009.\nThere was no change in those numbers for MagSafe 2. But, in the three years\nsince the MacBook Pro was released, there has been no increase in the\naccidental damage rate from a reported cable snag at all.\n\nWith a 11-hour battery, we're not sure why you'd want to string a power cord\nalong a transit route anyway. If you're that concerned about it, buy a USB-PD\nbattery and keep it next to your computer.\n\nIf you're still not happy that MagSafe is gone, there are inexpensive options\non Amazon.\n\n## The MacBook Pro is a workhorse, but is not a desktop\n\nThe MacBook Pro is not going to be the same maximum speed as the Mac Pro. It\nisn't even going to top the iMac Pro in every regard. But, it is portable, and\nit is very, very fast.\n\nIf you're doing long runs of rendering or the like, the iMac Pro will work\nbetter for you. Despite some social media posts to the contrary, the iMac Pro\nis in no way a portable machine. While the new Mac Pro doesn't have those\nseemingly sharpened handles that the old-school Mac Pro did, it isn't really\nportable either, even if you spring for the wheels.\n\nAs the last two i9 MacBook Pro were, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a solid\nmachine, one that is faster than literally every other MacBook Pro ever made,\nif not by a lot.\n\nNo matter how much of a Pro you are, not everything is a long processing job,\nconstantly slamming the processor. Even most editing tasks aren't constantly\npushing your CPU and GPU to the absolute limits. As we've said time and time\nagain, considering your own workflow in regards to what you do most of the\ntime is crucial in making this decision.\n\n\n\nEditing in the Final Cut Pro X on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\nIf you're coming from a 2018 or earlier MacBook Pro, including the i9 2018\nMacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with either flavor of i9 processor is\nunquestionably a great choice. However, the real-world performance for nearly\nevery task that you will do, minus those blue-moon processor-crushing ones,\nthe i9 performance isn't supremely higher than that of the i7 \"baseline\"\nmodel.\n\nAs with every other i9 MacBook Pro, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a lot of\ncomputer, with a lot of power, for a lot of money. There are cheaper machines\nwith the i9, dealing with many of the same thermal constraints, running\nWindows.\n\nHow much is macOS worth to you? You can say all you want that there are\ncheaper Windows options, and you'll be right. But, none of them bring macOS to\nthe table.\n\nAs it was before, and as it remains, a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an i9\nprocessor is the right tool for macOS jobs that demand portability. It is not\nthe ultimate solution to every macOS-centric computing problem, and those\npeople that need that solution probably already know that they need to wait\nfor the Mac Pro tower.\n\n## Score 4.5 out of 5\n\n## Save hundreds on the 16-inch MacBook Pro\n\nApple resellers are accepting orders for the **new 16-inch MacBook Pro** with\na variety of incentives. **Expercom** is knocking up to $438 off select new\nconfigurations with coupon code **appleinsider** , while **Adorama** is taking\nup to $250 off retail models with promo code **APINSIDER** (prices start at\njust $2,199 with code).

        "articleBody": "\n\nThe Jupiter moon Europa's elusive and enigmatic water-vapor plumes do indeed\nseem to be real.\n\nNASA's Hubble Space Telescope has spotted indirect evidence of such plumes\nemanating from Europa, which is thought to harbor a huge, salty ocean beneath\nits ice shell. And researchers have now detected one such plume's water vapor\ndirectly for the first time, a new study reports.\n\n\"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus\nand sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are\nfound all over the solar system. But the third — liquid water — is somewhat\nhard to find beyond Earth,\" study lead author Lucas Paganini, a planetary\nscientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and\nAmerican University in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.\n\n\"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the\nnext best thing: water in vapor form,\" Paganini added.\n\n**Related:** **Possible Water Plumes on Europa: The Discovery in Images**\n\nPaganini and his colleagues used the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to study\nthe 1,900-mile-wide (3,100 kilometers) Europa, which astrobiologists regard as\none of the solar system's best bets to host alien life.\n\nThe researchers observed Europa for 17 nights, from February 2016 through May\n2017. On one of those nights — April 26, 2016 — they got a strong signal of\nwater vapor, in the form of a characteristic wavelength of emitted infrared\nlight.\n\nAnd there was quite a bit of the stuff — about 2,300 tons (2,095 metric tons),\naccording to the researchers' calculations. That's almost enough to fill an\nOlympic-size swimming pool (which contains about 2,750 tons, or 2,500 metric\ntons, of water).\n\nThe researchers think the source of this water is a plume, which could be\ncoming from the buried ocean or from a reservoir of melted ice within Europa's\nshell. For starters, the observed volume is much higher than what is predicted\nto result from \"exogenic\" processes, such as the stripping of water molecules\nfrom Europa's surface by Jupiter's powerful radiation belts. And such\nstripping would likely occur fairly regularly, or at least often enough to be\nnoted more than one night out of 17, Paganini and his team wrote in the new\npaper, which was published online today (Nov. 18) in the journal Nature\nAstronomy.\n\nMultiple lines of evidence now point to the existence of plumes on Europa. For\nexample, in addition to the new results and Hubble's detection of atomic\nhydrogen and oxygen (which presumably came from water molecules split apart by\nradiation), NASA's Galileo Jupiter probe measured a big increase in the\ndensity of plasma, or ionized gas, during a Europa flyby in 1997.\n\nAnd it's becoming increasingly clear that Europa's plumes are sporadic. In\nthat regard, they're very different from the constant plume wafting from the\nsouth pole of Saturn's icy, ocean-harboring moon Enceladus, which is generated\nby more than 100 powerful geysers that are always on.\n\n\"For me, the interesting thing about this work is not only the first direct\ndetection of water above Europa, but also the lack thereof within the limits\nof our detection method,\" Paganini said.\n\nPlumes like those emanating from Enceladus and Europa are very exciting to\nastrobiologists, because they're sending \"free samples\" from potentially\nhabitable environments out into space for potential snagging by robotic\nprobes. And there's a possibility that a NASA spacecraft could soon do just\nthat, if everything works out just right.\n\nNASA is developing a mission called Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to\nlaunch in the mid-2020s. Clipper will orbit Jupiter but study Europa up close\non dozens of flybys, characterizing the moon and its ocean and hunting for\nspots where a potential life-hunting lander could touch down in the future.\nClipper could end up zooming through the plume on one or more of those flybys,\nif mission team members learn enough about the feature in the coming years —\nor if they just get really lucky.\n\nNASA Europa Mission Could Potentially Spot Signs of Alien Life\n\nPhotos: Europa, Mysterious Icy Moon of Jupiter\n\nKeck Observatory: Twin Telescopes on Mauna Kea\n\n_Mike Wall's book about the search for alien life, \"_ _Out There_ _\" (Grand\nCentral Publishing, 2018; illustrated by_ _Karl Tate_ _), is out now.

        "articleBody": "\n\nBelow, we analyze the snap counts and stats on defense for the Cleveland\nBrowns’ Week 11 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n### Defensive Line\n\n1 tackle (1 combined). 1 sack, 1 TFL, 2 QH.DLMyles Garrett5777%1 tackle (1\ncombined). 3 QH.DLChad Thomas5777%3 tackles (3 combined). 1 sack, 1 TFL, 1 QH,\n1 pass defended.DLSheldon Richardson4966%2 tackles, 1 assist (3 combined). 1\nQH.DLChris Smith2939%1 assist (1 combined). 1 QH.DLDevaroe Lawrence2838%No\nstats registered.DLEli Ankou1318%1 tackle (1 combined). 1 TFL.\n\n* There is a lot to sort through here. As a defense, the Browns had 11 hits on\n\n**Mason Rudolph**\n\n* (well, 12 if you count the helmet hit). 8 of those hits came from the defensive line. 5 of those hits were from two players facing suspension now (2 for\n\n**Larry Ogunjobi**\n\n* , 3 for\n\n**Myles Garrett**\n\n* ).\n\nOgunjobi\n\n* and\n\nGarrett\n\n* have been playing a ton of snaps all season. Since\n\n**Olivier Vernon’s**\n\n* injury a couple of weeks ago,\n\n**Chad Thomas**\n\n* has filled in and played way above my expectations (including logging another sack this week and almost having an interception). The problem is that Cleveland really doesn’t have a long-term option to replace those snaps in the starting lineup.\n\n* Ideally, Vernon would come back from his knee injury this week, but when he’ll return is still a question mark. Is veteran\n\n**Chris Smith**\n\n* going to get most of\n\nGarrett\n\n* ’s snaps (actually,\n\nThomas\n\n* would shift over)?\n\nSmith\n\n* is good for depth, but as a starter, that’s a hefty downgrade. The same goes for\n\nOgunjobi\n\n* up front.\n\n**Sheldon Richardson**\n\n* is the only starter in tact right now; I’d expect some works for this week’s game in Miami.\n\n### Linebacker\n\n* This was an amazing game for\n\n**Joe Schobert**\n\n* , who filled up the stat sheet in impressive fashion. Take a look at what PFF said about his performance:\n\n**Sione Takitaki**\n\n* played 6 snaps on defense, staying ahead of\n\n**Adarius Taylor**\n\n* on the depth chart.\n\n### Cornerback\n\n* He may not have been flagged a lot, so the stat sheet won’t show it, but this was a pretty rough game for\n\n**Greedy Williams**\n\n* . The Steelers had no offensive players (with experience) left, so they wisely took the approach of chucking the ball down the sideline and hoping for a catch or interference. Williams was flagged once for it, but was borderline on a few other plays, and against better receivers, would have allowed the big catches. He needs to get his head snapped around more on those plays to locate the ball. On the bright side, his run defense has been great.\n\n**Denzel Ward**\n\n* is still waiting for his first interception of the year. He almost had one against Pittsburgh, but the overthrown pass went off his hands.\n\n### Safety\n\n* The safety depth was tested against the Steelers, as\n\n**Damarious Randall**\n\n* was ejected mid-way through the game for a hit to the head, and\n\n**Morgan Burnett**\n\n* was lost to a season-ending Achilles’ injury. Safety depth has been shaky all season due to injury, and whatever that\n\n**Jermaine Whitehead**\n\n* experiment was.\n\n**Juston Burris**\n\n* and\n\n**Sheldrick Redwine**\n\n* both stepped up to the plate and did a good job. But that was against\n\n**Mason Rudolph**\n\n* , a below average quarterback. Fortunately,\n\nRandall\n\n* will be back, and Burnett was never viewed as a long-term answer at strong safety. I don’t know what direction\n\n**Steve Wilks**\n\n* will go at strong safety, but I like the way\n\nBurris\n\n* has played when given opportunities. When\n\n**Eric Murray**\n\n* returns from injury, it’ll probably be his starting job the rest of the way.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "The president’s unpredictability and demands of China are complicating an end\nto the long-running dispute, experts say.\n\n**Send any friend a story**\n\nAs a subscriber, you have **10 gift articles** to give each month. Anyone can\nread what you share.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen President Trump’s advisers suggested that Beijing resume buying around\n$20 billion in American farm products as part of a trade deal, Mr. Trump\nwasn’t satisfied. In a dramatic public retelling in the Cabinet Room, he said\nhe pressed his team to more than triple that figure, then trimmed that a\nlittle and asked for up to $50 billion in annual purchases.\n\n“My people had $20 billion done,” Mr. Trump recounted in an Oct. 21 cabinet\nmeeting. “And I said, ‘I want more.’ They said, ‘The farmers can’t handle it.’\nI said, ‘Tell them to buy larger tractors. It’s very simple.’” The cabinet\nmembers gathered around Mr. Trump laughed.\n\nMr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade talks\nwith China, injecting public drama into typically staid proceedings. He has\nalternated displays of anger and warmth toward Beijing and assumed the role of\nthe insatiable negotiator, pairing ambitious goals for a trade pact with even\nbigger threats should China not accede to his terms.\n\nBut more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern history,\nMr. Trump’s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he hoped for.\nInstead, the president’s cliffhanger tactics appear to have made it even\nharder to bring complex trade talks to a close and exacerbated economic\nuncertainty across the globe.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and China had\nreached a “historic” Phase 1 trade agreement, actually signing a deal has\nproved elusive. The two sides continue to negotiate and could finalize an\nagreement in the next few weeks, if negotiators decide to compromise. But Mr.\nTrump continues to give mixed signals about whether he actually wants a deal\nand if any of his tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be\nremoved.\n\n“We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,” Mr. Trump\nsaid on Nov. 8. “I like our situation very much. They want to make a deal much\nmore than I do, but we could have a deal.”\n\nA prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It allows\nhim to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid Democratic\ncriticism that he is caving to Beijing.\n\nBut businesses are not entertained. The unrelenting trade fight has prolonged\nfinancial pain for American farmers, companies and consumers, paralyzing firms\nthat rely on robust trade flows between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nExecutives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone some\nhiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not crippled by\nunforeseen policies, and conserve cash.\n\nThe uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly\nmanufacturing, which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese\neconomic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades, while\nGermany has barely avoided falling into recession.\n\n“It’s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical tensions\nare threatening to put the brakes on growth,” John Williams, the president of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. “The\nuncertainty created by current events is no doubt having a lasting effect on\nthe economic conditions we’re experiencing today.”\n\nMr. Trump’s theatrical embrace is not limited to China. He has injected\nsimilar drama into trade talks with other partners, including Europe, Japan,\nCanada and Mexico, publicly threatening them with tariffs and suggesting he\nmight leave some trading partners behind.\n\nThe president says his approach has created leverage — and in some cases, he\nis right. The threat of tariffs has prompted officials from Mexico, Canada,\nJapan and elsewhere to make concessions they might not otherwise have agreed\nto. It has also brought China, which is heavily reliant on exports to the\nUnited States, to the negotiating table.\n\n## Business & Economy: Latest Updates\n\nUpdated\n\nNov. 9, 2021, 11:31 p.m. ET\n\nRivian prices its I.P.O., valuing the electric-vehicle maker at nearly $70\nbillion.\n\nBut that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks to a\nclose. Mr. Trump’s tendency to waver and increase his demands have made China\nwary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only demand more, people\nfamiliar with Chinese trade policy said.\n\nEswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the president’s “mercurial\ntemperament and predilection to undercutting his own negotiating team” had\ncomplicated the already challenging task of striking a deal. “By hyping up\nexpectations and setting unrealistic goals for the trade talks, Trump makes\nthe prospects for any sort of trade deal with China more uncertain and\nvolatile,” he said.\n\nThe two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr. Trump and\nhis Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was canceled because of\ndomestic protests. Mr. Trump has since said that a deal signing would take\nplace in United States “farm country,” but the Chinese have been reluctant to\ncommit to a meeting until a deal that includes tariff reductions is finalized.\n\nWithout a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external pressure\nto get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the president’s\nunpredictable behavior — as demonstrated by his abrupt departure from a high-\nprofile meeting last February in Hanoi with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.\nThey fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving fewer concessions than they\nanticipate, resulting in an embarrassing trip for Mr. Xi, according to people\nfamiliar with their thinking.\n\nImage\n\nMr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he is the\nonly president tough enough to take on China without fear of repercussions and\nthat the United States will be better off. Many businesses agree that China\nhas long taken advantage of the United States and support Mr. Trump’s efforts\nto remove trade barriers and end coercive practices that have disadvantaged\nAmerican firms operating in China.\n\nBut they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly escalated\ntensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most expected. The lack\nof resolution has been discouraging, given that many analysts believe that the\nadministration is tackling only the easiest issues in its Phase 1 deal, and\nleaving more contentious topics, like the subsidies that China gives to its\nindustry, for later talks.\n\nThe roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that thrive on\ncertainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust shipments of\nproducts that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent twists in the China\ntrade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15 percent tariff that the\nTrump administration had planned to impose Dec. 15 on another $160 billion of\ngoods, including smartphones, laptops and footwear, would go into effect — or\nwhether a 15 percent tariff imposed on consumer goods in September would\nremain.\n\n“It makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,” said Phil Levy,\nthe chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates international shipments for\ncompanies. “It really doesn’t fit well with the world of global supply chains.\nAnd we’re talking to a lot of businesses who are having difficulty with that.\n**”**\n\nEven Mr. Trump’s supporters have trouble at times disguising their frustration\nwith his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging feeling that the\npresident doesn’t want the show to end.\n\nIn a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the\nAmerican Farm Bureau, said farmers faced “near-unprecedented economic\nuncertainty and hardship” stemming from the escalation of tariffs in China and\nother key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon as possible,\nsaying “time is running out for many in agriculture.”\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s approach has complicated his ability to get a final deal,\nincluding securing the big farm commitments that he showcased last month.\nAmerican negotiators are now left with the difficult task of translating the\nmassive purchases Mr. Trump requested — larger purchases “than any time in our\nhistory, by far” — into the actual text of a trade agreement.\n\nWhile China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and pork,\nit has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations that it\nfavors American products over other countries’, as well as agreements that\ncould result in more American tariffs if its purchases do not come through.\n\nEven if American negotiators secure better market access for beef, pork, dairy\nand genetically modified products, Washington-based analysts who have done the\ncalculations say they have difficulty figuring out how the United States could\nincrease its agricultural exports to China to much more than $30 billion a\nyear, without diverting trade from elsewhere.\n\nMr. Trump’s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his\nadministration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing levies\nwill be removed if a deal is reached.\n\nThe president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the Oval\nOffice with Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump canceled an\nincrease in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention of rolling back\nany levies. That has not gone over well with the Chinese, who have since been\nunder pressure domestically for seemingly giving away too much to the United\nStates.\n\n“Without rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty of not\nraising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the additional incentive\nof implementing this deal on the Chinese part?” He Jianxiong, the former\nexecutive director for China at the International Monetary Fund, said at a\nNov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in Washington.\n\nKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\n\n",

Coba lagi nanti.\n\nOktober 27, 2015 by Admin\n\nSebelum Islam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah zaman Khalifah Ali karena\npemberontakan Mu’awiyah di tahun 37 Hijriyah. 26 tahun setelah wafatnya Nabi.\nIslam sudah sempurna secara aqidah mau pun fiqih. Islam sudah sempurna sebelum\nNabi Muhammad SAW wafat. Jadi baik Sunni dan Syiah yg sebagian besar sahabat\nNabi itu aqidah dan ibadahnya sama: Islam.\n\nZaman Sahabat itu zaman terbaik Islam. Karena Islam saat itu sudah sempurna\ndan amat murni. Masih banyak orang2 yg melihat langsung amal ibadah Nabi,\nngobrol bersama Nabi, berjuang bersama Nabi. Sementara kita di akhir zaman ini\nbelum tentu benar karena sudah diselubungi fitnah.\n\nIslam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syi’ah karena faktor politik. Karena kekuasaan.\nPendukung Ali disebut Syiah Ali yg kemudian disebut Syiah saja. Pendukung\nMuawiyah dan yg netral disebut Sunni.\n\nSetelah pecah itulah jalan sendiri2.\n\nImam Ja’far Ash Shadiq yg merupakan guru dari Imam Malik dan Imam Abu Hañifah\nmembentuk Mazhab Ja’fari. Imam Malik yg merupakan guru dari Imam Syafi’ie\nmembentuk mazhab Maliki. Imam Abu Hanifah membentuk mazhab Hanafi. Imam\nSyafi’ie guru dari Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Syafi’ie. Imam Ahmad\nbin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Hanbali. Mereka semua punya hubungan guru dan\nmurid.\n\nDari sini juga perawi hadits Sunni dan Syiah jalan sendiri2. Imam Kulayni\nbikin kitab hadits Al Kafi. Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim dsb bikin kitab Shahih\nBukhari, Shahih Muslim dsb. Sebagian perawi haditsnya dari Syiah bahkan di\nRijalul Hadits ada yg disebut Rafidhi karena tak membolehkan orang bernama\nMu’awiyah masuk ke rumahnya.\n\nAda juga percampuran Ilmu misalnya orang Syiah belajar dari ulama Sunni dan\norang Sunni belajar dari ulama Syiah. Contoh kitab Subulus Salam yg biasa\ndiajarkan di pesantren2 NU ternyata disusun oleh ulama Syiah.\n\nCuma sekali lagi zaman Nabi Islam sudah sempurna. Jadi saat para sahabat pecah\njadi Sunni dan Syiah, Islam mereka sudah sempurna meski saat itu mazhab fiqih\ndan kitab2 hadits belum ditulis.\n\nJadi keliru karena Syiah beda dgn Sunni langsung dibilang bukan Islam.\nPelajari dulu sejarah Islam dari berbagai sumber. Bukan dgn 1 mata.⁠⁠\n\nPenghinaan terhadap Istri dan Sahabat Nabi\n\nSebelumnya kita tegaskan bahwa menghina istri Nabi Siti ‘Aisyah ra dan\nmenghina Khulafaur Rosyidiin seperti Abu Bakar ra, Umar bin Khoththob ra,\nUsman bin Affan ra, dan Ali bin Abi Talib ra adalah perbuatan yang sesat.\nHarusnya dapat sanksi hukum misalnya 10 tahun penjara atau lebih berat lagi.\n\nSyi’ah Rafidhoh yang gemar menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi seperti Yasir Habib\ndan Tawhidi ternyata dipelihara Zionis Yahudi untuk memecah-belah Islam. Video\nYasir Habib saat syahadah sering disebar ole Wahabi. Untuk menimbulkan\nkemarahan dan perang sesama Islam tentunya. Yasir Habib ternyata dipelihara\nLondon dan diberi dana untuk bikin Fadak TV. Tawhidi yang sekarang diundang ke\nIndonesia oleh Emilia Renita dari Oase dipelihara oleh Australia. Gunanya\nuntuk membuat Indonesia kacau.\n\nBukan cuma istri dan sahabat Nabi yang dihina oleh Rafidhi macam Yasir Habib.\nBahkan Imam tertinggi Syi’ah pun seperti Ali Khamenei mereka hina karena\nmengharamkan penghinaan tsb.\n\n## Ahmadinejad: Siapa Menghina Sahabat Rasulullah Sekutu Musuh Islam\n\nPresiden Ahmadinejad menandaskan, “Dari tribun ini saya tegaskan bahwa barang\nsiapa di mana pun ia berada menghina sahabat Rasulullah saw, maka ia bukanlah\nseorang muslim dan tidak bergerak di atas jalan Islam. Ia tidak lebih hanyalah\nkaki tangan dan alat mainan musuh-musuh asing.”\n\nhttp://www.ipabionline.com/2013/02/ahmadinejad-siapa-menghina-\nsahabat.html#ixzz2PpyAj3AN\n\n## Khamenei: Haram Menghina Istri Nabi dan Simbol Ahlusunah\n\nhttp://syiahali.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/fatwa-para-ulama-larangan-mencaci-\npara-sahabat/\n\n## Fatwa Para Ulama Syi’ah Larangan Mencaci Para Sahabat\n\nhttp://www.shia-explained.com/my/archives/2364\n\nSekarang kita lihat asal muasal penghinaan terhadap istri dan sahabat Nabi.\n\nSaya dulu merasa kehidupan semua sahabat rukun dan damai. Itu benar di zaman\nNabi. Saat Nabi wafat, timbul perdebatan siapa yang berhak menjadi pemimpin\nummat Islam sebagai Nabi. Kaum Syi’ah umumnya berpendapat Ali berhak menjadi\nKhalifah. Sementara mayoritas sahabat mengangkat Abu Bakar ra sebagai\nKhalifah. Suka tidak suka, semua sahabat membai’at Abu Bakar sebagai Khalifah.\nTermasuk Ali.\n\nSaat Ali jadi khalifah, Siti ‘Aisyah memberontak dalam perang yang disebut\nPerang Jamal yang menewaskan 17.000 orang. Saat Mu’awiyah berontak dalam\nperang Siffin pun ada 70.000 Muslim yang tewas. Dari pihak Ali 25.000 orang\nyang tewas. Dari pihak Mu’awiyah, 45.000 orang yang tewas.\n\nNah kalau para sahabat ini saling bunuh dalam Perang Jamal dan Perang Siffin,\ntentu diawali dengan perang lisan dan juga tulisan. Saling hina. Bisa jadi\ntulisan2 yang mengina sampai ke kita hingga sekarang. Ini mirip saat Pilpres\n2014 antara Jokowi melawan Prabowo di mana masing2 pengikut menghina yang\nlain. Bahkan Jokowi difitnah sebagai kafir sehingga keluarlah foto2 Jokowi\nsedang sholat.\n\nItulah asal muasal penghinaan istri dan sahabat Nabi. Itu satu lembaran hitam\nsejarah yang harusnya kita tutup. Menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi yg dilakukan\nsebagian kaum Syi’ah dan menghina orang tua Nabi yg dilakukan Wahabi itu dosa\nbesar. Cuma kalau taubat dan pemimpinnya mengharamkannya, ya selesai. Allah\nMaha Pengampun.\n\nManusia itu sifatnya salah dan lupa. Sebaik2 orang salah adalah orang yang\ntaubat. Nabi Adam dan Nabi Yunus pun pernah salah, tapi begitu tobat, diampuni\noleh Allah. Begitu. Makanya KH Quraish Shihab saat menilai Syi’ah itu sesat\natau lurus, beliau juga melihat perkembangan mereka. Yang tobat dan\nmengharamkan penghinaan thd sahabat ya otomatis tidak sesat. Sebaliknya yang\ntetap menghina, ini sesat.\n\nPenghinaan pun macam-macam tingkatnya. Dari sekedar kritik yang santun, hingga\npenghinaan yang amat amat keji. Kitabnya pun ada. Sahabat yang dihina pun\nmacam-macam. Dari sahabat Abu Bakar ra dan Umar bin Khoththob yang namanya\ndijamin Nabi masuk surga, hingga Mu’awiyah yang masuk Islam setelah Futuh\nMekkah da anaknya Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, Sayyidina\nHusein ra.\n\nMenghina Siti Aisyah ra, Abu Bakar ra, dan Umar bin Khoththob ra tidak\ndibenarkan apa pun alasannya. Sesat. Sebaliknya menyatakan bahwa Mu’awiyah\nberontak terhadap Khalifah Ali atau Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu\nNabi, itu sekedar kritik berdasarkan fakta sejarah. Namun kaum Sunni tetap\nmenjaga lisan mereka untuk tidak mengutuk atau menghina Mu’awiyah dan Yazid.\nUrusan mereka ada di tangan Allah.\n\nFiled under: Syi'ah |\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\nAfter a three-year silence, there has been news on the fourth film in rebooted\n_Star Trek_ film series: Noah Hawley, best known for creating FX’s _Legion_\nand _Fargo_ TV series, is in final talks to write and direct it, according to\nreports from _The Wrap_ and _Deadline_.\n\nThe most recent _Star Trek_ film was 2016’s _Star Trek Beyond._ Unlike the\noriginal two films in the modern iteration of the franchise, _Star Trek\nBeyond_ was directed by Justin Lin; 2009’s _Star Trek_ and 2013’s _Star Trek\nInto Darkness_ were directed by J.J. Abrams. Abrams was a producer on _Star\nTrek Beyond_ , and will be reprising the role in the as-yet-untitled fourth\nfilm.\n\nThis will be Hawley’s second film\n\nThe fourth _Star Trek_ film was greenlit in 2016, with reports that Chris\nHemsworth would be returning to the franchise to reprise his role as George\nKirk, the father of Chris Pine’s Captain James T. Kirk. Obviously, three years\nis a long time, and actors’ schedules shift. It’s unclear whether Hawley’s\nfilm is still based on the 2016 plan, or if Hemsworth will return — both\nHemsworth and Pine were said to have had run into contractual issues in 2018,\naccording to _The_ _Hollywood Reporter_. _The Wrap’s_ report today claims that\nPine will be back on board the Enterprise, along with Zachary Quinto, Zoe\nSaldana, Simon Pegg, and Karl Urban. It doesn’t mention Hemsworth.\n\nThere are three scripts still in contention for the fourth _Trek_ film,\naccording to _The Wrap_ , so it’s possible Paramount is still deciding on a\ndirection. As if things weren’t murky enough, _Deadline_ reports that\nParamount is also still working on a second, R-rated _Star Trek_ spin-off from\nQuentin Tarantino, which has been rumored since 2017.\n\nThe fourth _Star Trek_ movie will be Hawley’s second film. _Lucy in the Sky,_\nhis debut, is a slightly more grounded story about a NASA astronaut dealing\nwith life on Earth. That movie was poorly-recieved by critics — and flopped at\nthe box office, making $320,000 on a budget of $27 million, according to Box\nOffice Mojo.\n\nNo release date for the fourth _Star Trek_ film has yet been announced.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a former\nNational Security Council official, testified side-by-side before the House\nIntelligence Committee Tuesday about the events at the center of the\nimpeachment inquiry. Volker said he had no knowledge of any efforts to urge\nUkraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nMorrison was the third witness testifying Tuesday who listened in on President\nTrump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he\nwasn't concerned about the content of the call, but he did worry there would\nbe \"political consequences\" if more people had access to the call summary.\n\nRepublicans also questioned Morrison about his closed-door testimony, in which\nhe raised questions about the judgment of another witness, Alexander Vindman,\nwho is the White House National Security Council Ukraine expert. After Fiona\nHill left the NSC, it was Morrison who took over, and Vindman reported to him.\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\n### \"My fears have been realized\"\n\nMorrison told the Intelligence Committee, \"I feared at the time of the call on\nJuly 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington's political climate. My\nfears have been realized.\"\n\nHe begged lawmakers \"not to lose sight of\" the ongoing Ukraine conflict or the\nillegal occupation by Russia of Crimea, and work to reform Ukraine. \"Every day\nthat the focus of discussion of Ukraine is centered on these proceedings\ninstead of those matters is a day when we are not focused on the interests\"\nmutually shared by Ukraine and the U.S., he warned.\n\n### 2\\. Never urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden\n\n\"At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine\nto investigate former Vice President Biden,\" Volker said in his opening\nstatement. \"As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have\nprovided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not\non the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. I\nwas not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by\nPresident Trump until the transcript of that call was released on September\n25, 2019.\"\n\nVolker later said he would have \"objected\" to Ukraine opening an investigation\ninto Biden and did not realize Mr. Trump saw the request to investigate\nUkrainian energy company Burisma as tantamount to investigating Biden until he\nheard the July 25 call.\n\n\"I think the allegations against Vice President Biden are self-serving and not\ncredible,\" Volker said. Volker reiterated that he saw the investigations into\nBurisma and into Biden as separate but that in retrospect, he understood how\nUkrainian officials could be confused.\n\n### 3\\. \"Not some irregular channel\"\n\nVolker disputed the notion that he had been a participant in what's been\nportrayed as an outside or \"irregular\" channel of Ukraine policy. \"My role was\nnot some irregular channel, but the official channel,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nHe denied that he, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry formed an \"irregular\" channel, for which they were\nknown as the \"Three Amigos.\"\n\nVolker said he never used the term \"three amigos\" and added, \"I frankly cringe\nwhen I hear it.\"\n\n### 4\\. Questioning Vindman's judgment\n\nRepublican counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison about concerns within the NSC\nabout Alexander Vindman's judgment. He asked Morrison about concerns his\npredecessor, Fiona Hill, might have had, but Morrison's lawyer said the\nquestion was outside the scope of his testimony.\n\nMorrison did reference his earlier testimony, in which he said others had\nraised concerns about Vindman potentially leaking information, a prospect\nVindman denied earlier in the day.\n\nMorrison also said he was surprised that Vindman did not come to him about\nconcerns regarding the July 25 call but instead went straight to the NSC legal\ncounsel.\n\n\"If he had concerns about the content of the call, that's something I would've\nexpected to be notified about,\" Morrison, Vindman's superior, said. In his\ntestimony Tuesday morning, Vindman said he was told by former National\nSecurity Adviser John Bolton — Morrison's supervisor — to go straight to the\nNSC legal counsel with his concerns.\n\nMorrison also testified that Vindman had become frustrated over his exclusion\nfrom some important meetings relating to Ukraine policy.\n\n### 5\\. Ukraine military aid and mixed messaging\n\n\"I opposed the hold on U.S. security assistance as soon as I learned about it\non July 18, and thought we could turn it around before the Ukrainians ever\nknew or became alarmed about it,\" Volker said. He added that he viewed the\ndelay \"as a U.S. policy problem that we needed to fix internally.\"\n\nVolker said he first discussed the delay with the Ukrainians at the end of\nAugust, after Politico reported the aid had been paused.\n\n\"Instead of telling them that they needed to do something to get the hold\nreleased, I told them the opposite - that they should not be alarmed, it was\nan internal U.S. problem, and we were working to get it fixed,\" Volker said.\n\"I did not know others were conveying a different message to them around that\nsame time.\"\n\n### 6\\. \"The Gordon problem\"\n\nMorrison testified that he didn't always follow through on suggestions from\nSondland. He said his predecessor, Fiona Hill, had dubbed Sondland's role in\nforming Ukraine policy as \"the Gordon problem.\"\n\n### 7\\. \"The Giuliani problem\"\n\nVolker told the committee he tried to work with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer,\nRudy Giuliani, to try to convince him, and therefore the president, that the\nnew Ukrainian president was not corrupt. However, he said the July 25 call\nmade him realize Giuliani and the president still believed Ukraine needed to\ninvestigate Burisma and the Bidens.\n\n\"So it's fair to say you have not fixed the 'Giuliani problem'?\" Schiff asked.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Volker said.\n\n",

In a\nnew case study out Monday, they detail how the man came down with a rare form\nof allergy to the bird feathers that filled his new duvet and pillows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the study, published in BMJ Case Reports, the 43-year-old man had\nsuffered months of dizziness, fatigue, and breathlessness by the time he\nvisited his local doctor in November 2016.\n\nAt first, his doctor assumed he had a lower respiratory tract infection, like\nbronchitis, and his symptoms did improve soon after. But by December, they\nworsened, to the point where he could no longer walk to the next room in his\nhouse without feeling out of breath. His doctor referred him to an urgent\nrespiratory care clinic and sought out advice from one of the study authors,\nOwen Dempsey, a chest doctor at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n\n“Their immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion—think Donald Trump\nrather than Barack Obama”\n\nDempsey talked with the man over the phone, trying to zero in any potential\ncauses for his symptoms. And once the man mentioned that he and his wife had\nrecently switched from synthetic bedding to a feather duvet and feather\npillows, Dempsey quickly came up with a preliminary diagnosis that was later\nconfirmed by lab testing: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or HP.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission\n\n**All colors on sale today**\n\nGizmodo describes these premium headphones as “annoyingly incredible.\" This is\nthe lowest we've seen the Apple AirPods Max yet.\n\nThe man had a particular form of HP that tends to strike people who raise or\nwork closely with birds, which has earned it the nickname of “bird fancier’s\nlung.” But in cases where people have gotten HP simply from being exposed to\nfeather bedding, it’s instead been dubbed “feather duvet lung.”\n\n“In some individuals that meet proteins from bird droppings or dust from their\nfeathers, their immune system behaves in an exaggerated fashion—think Donald\nTrump rather than Barack Obama,” Dempsey told Gizmodo by email.\n\nHP, as Gizmodo very recently explained, is a complex and rare condition. It\ninvolves different antibodies than the ones that cause a typical food or skin\nallergy. That means it isn’t detectable through a standard allergy test, nor\ndo people react instantaneously when they’re exposed to their trigger. It’s\nalso not clear why any one person develops HP, since many of us can carry\nthese specific antibodies to a trigger but never become sick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Most people of course don’t get this, and it depends on how their immune\nsystem is primed and is affected by their genetics,” Dempsey said.\n\nBecause Dempsey quickly suspected feather duvet lung, though, he told the man\nto remove the bedding from his home the very first time they spoke. And within\ndays, he began to improve. Subsequent treatment with steroids seemed to speed\nup his recovery, though Dempsey noted there’s no definitive evidence that\nsteroids will help with HP. Regardless, by the time he was weaned off\ntreatment a year later, he was back to normal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,”\nthe man wrote in a patient perspective accompanying the case report.\n\nWhile it’s likely that more people contract feather duvet lung than is\ndocumented, given how hard it is to diagnose, it’s not something you should be\nworried about if you’ve been sleeping contently under a down-filled duvet with\nno issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Hold onto your feather bedding, but if you do get chest symptoms, e.g.\nbreathlessness or cough, mention it to your health care professional,” Dempsey\nsaid. “Most don’t think about it.”\n\nI think that sums up things pretty well.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Tom Davies | Associated Press\n\nIndianapolis – Several thousand teachers wearing red surrounded the Indiana\nStatehouse on Tuesday to call for better pay and more respect from the\nRepublican-dominated state government in a protest that closed more than half\nof the state’s school districts for the day.\n\nThe union-organized rally represented Indiana’s biggest such teacher protest\namid a wave of educator activism across the country over the past two years.\n\nTeachers chanted, “Fund our schools,” and “Put kids first,” as hundreds of\nthem lined entrances to the Statehouse, many holding handmade signs with\nsayings such as, “Less Money on Testing, More Money on Students.” Teachers\nwith marching band instruments played “We’re Not Gonna Take It” from the\nStatehouse steps.\n\nHigh school math teacher Angela Cooper said she and more than 40 fellow\nteachers from the Gibson Southern schools near Evansville left about 4:30 a.m.\nfor the rally. She said a top worry is low pay causing many new teachers to\nleave for other jobs.\n\n“We need to make sure we keep teachers in the classroom,” Cooper said. “They\nstart in the classroom but then they leave because they aren’t paid enough.”\n\nIndiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill told a few thousand\nteachers who covered the Statehouse lawn that the Legislature should direct\nmoney from the state’s $2 billion in cash reserves toward helping schools.\n\n“The crisis is now, and we need action now,” Gambill said to cheers from the\ncrowd. “The issue is funding, and the state has the money.”\n\nNearly 300 school districts closed because of the rally, according to teachers\nunions. It came as legislators gather for organizational meetings ahead of\ntheir 2020 session that starts in early January. The unions said more than\n15,000 people registered for the rally. Indiana State Police reported at least\n5,000 people entered the Statehouse through public entrances, but the agency\ndidn’t estimate how many total were on the grounds.\n\nRepublican Gov. Eric Holcomb and leaders of the GOP-dominated Legislature have\navoided direct criticism of teachers or school districts for the closings.\nThey seem intent on not antagonizing educators as Kentucky GOP Gov. Matt\nBevin, who lost his reelection bid this month, did in lashing out at teachers\nwho used sick days to rally. However, they said they don’t expect to take\naction on further boosting school funding until at least 2021.\n\nOther teacher protests were held last year in West Virginia, Oklahoma and\nArizona.\n\nWhile some Indiana protesters chanted, “Red for Ed,” in a Statehouse hallway,\nIndiana House Speaker Brian Bosma spoke before lawmakers defending the state\nbudget approved by Republicans in April that boosted base school spending by\n2.5% each of the next two years. Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders touted\nthe plan as making strides toward improving teacher pay.\n\nBosma said lawmakers would take action to prevent the use of student test\nscores to evaluate teachers and schools after lower scores on the state’s new\nILEARN standardized exam taken last spring – one of the top concerns of the\nteachers unions.\n\n“We get that you’re frustrated,” Bosma said. “We get that you are concerned\nabout issues.”\n\nTeachers didn’t see Holcomb at the Statehouse on Tuesday. His office said he\nwas keeping long-standing plans for traveling to Florida for a conference of\nthe Republican Governors Association, which gave nearly $5.9 million toward\nHolcomb’s 2016 election campaign.\n\nThe governor said he was waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed in\nFebruary to make recommendations on increasing salaries by the end of 2020.\n\nEducation advocacy groups estimated this year that a 9% funding increase was\nneeded to boost average teacher pay to the midpoint of neighboring states.\nRepublican state schools Superintendent Jennifer McCormick has cited a study\nshowing Indiana as the state with the lowest teacher salary increases since\n2002.\n\nMcCormick, who has split from many fellow Republicans on issues such as the\nstate’s private school voucher program, told cheering teachers that they\nweren’t “asking for the moon.”\n\n“What a shame that it takes today to get what our kids deserve,” she said.\n\nJoel Schlabach, a teacher at eastern Indiana’s Richmond High School, said\npoliticians have “vilified” educators.\n\n“They think they know better about education than us,” he said. “They don’t\ntrust us to make important decisions about students whose names we know when\nwe’re in the classroom.”\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\nJames Van Der Beek has been eliminated from “Dancing with the Stars.”\n\nThe former “Dawson’s Creek” star, 42, was voted off the popular dance\ncompetition on Monday in a tight race against singer Ally Brooke after\nperforming two dances for judges Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann\nInaba.\n\nVan Der Beek was eliminated in what host Tom Bergeron described as the\n“hardest judge’s verdict so far this season.” The difficult elimination came\nin light of Van Der Beek’s announcement that his wife, Kimberly, had suffered\na miscarriage over the weekend.\n\nVan Der Beek revealed the news of the miscarriage in a video package earlier\nin the episode, noting that he and Kimberly experienced every parent’s “worst\nnightmare.”\n\n“My wife Kimberly and I went through every expecting parent’s worst nightmare.\nWe lost the baby,” Van Der Beek said. “The little soul that we had expected to\nwelcome into our family took a shortcut to whatever lies beyond.”\n\n“You never know why these things happen, that’s what I’ve been telling my\nkids. All you know is that it brings you closer together, it breaks you open,\nit opens your heart, it deepens your appreciation,” said the actor. “It makes\nyou more human.”\n\nThe news of the miscarriage came a month after Van Der Beek announced that\nKimberly was expecting on a previous episode of “DWTS.”\n\nThe actor shared a clip of his wife getting her first ultrasound with their\nother children in attendance.\n\n\"Hearing the heartbeat was something we never take for granted,\" the \"Pose\"\nactor previously said on \"DWTS.\" His wife has suffered several miscarriages in\nthe past.\n\nIn his initial Instagram announcement of the pregnancy, Van Der Beek even\ntouched upon the idea of miscarriage and noted there should be “zero shame”\ninvolved.\n\n\"@Vanderkimberly and I have been through three of those first appointments to\ndiscover either no heartbeat, or no baby, and she wanted to share this moment.\nMiscarriage (a word that needs a replacement – nobody failed to 'carry', these\nthings sometimes just happen) is something that people rarely talk about, and\noften go through in secret.\n\n\"But there needs to be zero shame around it, or around giving yourself the\ntime and space to grieve. We decided to put ourselves out there – not knowing\nwhat we’d find – in an effort to chip away at any senseless stigma around this\nexperience and to encourage people who might be going through it to open\nthemselves up to love & support from friends and family when they need it\nmost.\"\n\nThose involved with “DWTS” struggled with the decision to boot Van Der Beek\noff the show.\n\n“This is not easy. First of all, this is not at all what I expected to see\nhere,” judge Inaba noted as she made her decision.\n\nUpon hearing the news that she would be advancing to the finals, Brooke\noffered her spot to Van Der Beek.\n\n“Can I give it to James?” Brooke tearfully asked before apologizing to the\nactor.\n\nBergeron chimed in, noting that Brooke’s offer was “a lovely gesture.”\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Google’s long-gestating foray into gaming has finally arrived as the tech\ngiant’s game streaming service, Stadia, launched Tuesday morning.\n\n“Stadia has been built from the ground up to be a cloud platform,” Jack Buser,\ndirector for games at Google, tells _The Hollywood Reporter_. “You’re going to\nsee a number of things that Stadia can do that is not possible on other\nplatforms.”\n\nGoogle’s gaming offering, which is offered at a $9.99 monthly rate for its\nStadia Pro subscription (there is also a $129.99 Premiere Edition available\nfor preorder that includes a controller, Chromecast Ultra and three months of\nStadia Pro and a free tier of the Stadia service is due out next year), is\ncentered on the growing industry of game streaming, allowing players to access\nAAA titles while on-the-go through their smart phone device, tablet or\ncomputer, as well as their TV. The key to Stadia’s success, says Buser, is\nGoogle’s built-in infrastructure. “We have one of the largest private networks\nin the world,” he says, boasting that Google’s servers can “deliver extremely\nhigh fidelity content all over the world.” The goal is to deliver a “seamless\nexperience” that presents blockbuster games to Stadia users on whatever device\nthey choose to play on.\n\nStadia is launching with 22 games (the addition of 10 extra titles was\nannounced over the weekend after the initial dozen offerings were revealed\nlast week), featuring popular franchises such as _Assassin’s Creed, Tomb\nRaider, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny_ and more. Notably, only one title at\nlaunch is exclusive to the Stadia service, indie developer Tequila Works’\n_Gylt_ , while most of the other games offered have been on the market for\nmonths on various other platforms. More games are slated to roll out on Stadia\nthroughout the end of the year and into 2020.\n\nLewis Ward, research director of gaming VR/AR at tech market research firm\nIDC, sees Stadia’s lineup as its “Achilles heel.” While the monthly\nsubscription rate for the service gets players access to 4k streaming at 60\nframes per second and discounts on certain titles ( _Destiny 2_ is available\nfor free as a limited-time incentive at launch), the majority of titles for\nStadia will cost the same amount as their console counterparts, despite the\ngames having been on the market for some time already.\n\n“They need to ramp up the game catalog ASAP,” says Ward. “Google’s planned\n‘free’ base tier (you still have to buy the games outright) is its ace in the\nhole, as is its ability to promote Stadia through the YouTube Gaming\ncommunity…and that should seed interest in the Founder’s Edition bundle and\nPro service. I think that conversion will be tough, however, since the games\ncatalog will probably stay fairly thin and there’s a lot of other gaming\noptions out there.”\n\nFor established gaming powers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive (both\nof which have a number of games set as launch titles for Google’s platform),\nStadia represents an opportunity to reach a wider audience. “Google offers an\nextension of the market of people who can play our games,” says Chris Early,\nsenior vp partnerships and revenue at Ubisoft. “They help extend our reach by\nletting people who maybe don’t own a console or PC join in.”\n\n“Our strategy is to be where the consumer is,” Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-\nTwo, adds. “Generally speaking, in the entertainment business, broader\ndistribution is a good thing for consumers and customers. We’re excited by the\nopportunity and we’ll see how it goes.”\n\nGoogle is betting on streaming, which, depending on who you ask in the\nindustry, is seen as either the future of gaming or the present. Stadia is not\nthe only service to capitalizing on the new tech, as Sony has offered its Sony\nNow service since 2014 and Microsoft launched an early stage of its Project\nxCloud cloud-based gaming service across 13 markets earlier this year, with\nplans for its full launch set for next year.\n\nFor the nascent game streaming industry, “2020 will be about getting these\nservices in good working order and cautiously testing out how gamers respond,”\nWard says. “I think 2021 and 2022 will begin to see more of a muscular push by\nseveral of the large cloud-streamed gaming service providers.”\n\n“Streaming is somewhat binary,” says Early. “You are either in a place with\nadequate bandwidth or you’re not.” In places like San Francisco and New York,\nbandwidth is less of an issue than in more remote markets, but Early still\nsays Ubisoft are “believers” in game streaming as a viable future for the\nindustry.\n\n“The groundwork is there,” Buser says. “In terms of running games and having\nan experience that feels as good as or better than best consoles that exist\ntoday. The creativity that is coming from the game development community will\nbreak the boundaries of what was previously possible. It’s just staggering.”\n\nWhile Stadia’s current expected lineup is light on exclusive titles (only\nthree games available exclusively on the service have been announced), Early\nsays there is a possibility that future Ubisoft games could be built and\nlaunched specifically for the platform. “Our objective is to make the best\ngame and get it in front of as many people as possible,” he says. “I think the\ninteresting question is if we’re getting to a place that requires a game to be\nrun in the cloud, does that become Stadia exclusive? While the intent may not\nbe that, because [the game] may be exclusive to services that operate with a\ncloud base, whether that’s xCloud or Stadia or whatever else, that does become\nsomething we’d look at.”\n\nWhile aimed at a more casual audience, fellow tech powerhouse Apple also\nstepped into gaming earlier this year with the debut of its Apple Arcade\nsubscription service in September. A major difference in the two services was\nthe list of titles available at launch (more than 60) for Apple’s offering,\nall of which were new and exclusive to the platform, with more rolling out\neach week.\n\n“I think if [Google] gets to over 100 games by the time the free tier launches\nnext year that will be a big improvement, slow and painful as it is,” says\nWard.\n\nBuser, however, is counting on the performance of the new service, and the\nfuture of the gaming industry as a whole, to bolster Stadia in the early\ngoing. “This is where you’ll see the next big jump in what games can be,” he\nsays. “You’ll never download a game or have to download an update. We’re\nalready used to this in movies and TV, we just haven’t seen it in games yet.\nIt’s tough to go back to console.”\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\n**The United States faced stiff international and Palestinian criticism on\nTuesday over its decision to no longer consider Israeli settlements illegal,\nwhile the Jewish state's premier cheered on the \"historic\" move.**\n\nThe United Nations and European Union stressed the decision would not change\nthe reality that the settlements were illegal, while the Arab League condemned\nthe unilateral move announced on Monday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said he was \"very moved\"\nby the announcement.\n\n<https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x7o6g1x>\n\nPompeo said that after legal consultation Washington had concluded the\nestablishment of settlements was \"not, per se, inconsistent with international\nlaw\", saying he trusted the Israeli courts to decide.\n\nThe decision puts the US at odds with virtually the whole of the rest of the\ninternational community and breaks with Security Council resolutions declaring\nsettlements to be illegal as they are built on occupied Palestinian land.\n\nIsraeli courts, however, have declared most major settlements legal.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the US decision did\n\"not modify existing international law, nor its interpretation by the\nInternational Court of Justice and the UN Security Council\".\n\nThe EU reiterated it still considers all settlement activity illegal.\n\nNetanyahu visited the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank south of\nJerusalem on Tuesday.\n\n\"Here we are on a historic day with another tremendous achievement for the\nState of Israel,\" he told settler leaders, according to a statement.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump has \"corrected an historic\ninjustice and lined up with truth and justice\", Netanyahu said.\n\nMore than 600,000 Israelis live in settlements in east Jerusalem and the West\nBank, alongside more than three million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael seized control of the territories, seen as pivotal parts of any future\nPalestinian state, in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nSettlements are seen as one of the most difficult issues in the decades-long\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe announcement is the latest in a series of pro-Israeli moves by Trump's\nadministration, including recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as\nIsrael's capital.\n\nAnalysts say it will further embolden the settlement movement and may fend off\npotential legal moves against Israel.\n\nThe Arab League called it an \"extremely adverse development\".\n\nThe Palestinian Authority - which considers the US biased and has rejected the\nTrump administration as a mediator if peace talks are ever revived - called\nfor an emergency meeting of the body.\n\nThe only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel - Egypt and\nJordan - also sharply criticised the US policy shift, with Jordanian Foreign\nMinister Ayman Safadi warning of \"dangerous consequences\".\n\nPalestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said they would take a series of\nmeasures to oppose it, including calling for a UN Security Council debate.\n\n\"We are going to the (UN) General Assembly and we will ask... the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official judicial\ninvestigation,\" he added.\n\nKey Security Council powers distanced themselves from the US position, to\nvarying degrees.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said it viewed Washington's move as \"another measure\ncontradicting\" the legal footing for a peace deal and said it would likely\nfurther heighten tensions on the ground.\n\nThe French foreign ministry said it \"regrets any decision likely to\nencourage... settlement building\".\n\nA spokesperson for the British Foreign Office reiterated the UK's position\nthat settlements \"are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to\npeace and threaten the physical viability of a two-state solution\".\n\nThe US policy shift was widely seen as an attempt to change the legal context\nfor a series of suits and complaints against Israel.\n\nThe European Union's top court last week ruled that EU countries must identify\nproducts made in Israeli settlements on their labels.\n\nThe ICC is expected to take key decisions on two cases against Israel in the\ncoming weeks, including relating to Israeli settlements.\n\nIsraeli settlers, who overwhelmingly form part of Netanyahu's right-wing\nconstituency, said the US policy change paved the way for the annexation of\nWest Bank settlements into Israel.\n\n\"The illegality of settlements has always been stated as a fact based upon an\ninternational consensus. The breaking of that consensus is important,\" said\nAvi Bell, senior fellow at the right-wing Kohelet Policy Forum in Israel.\n\nErekat said it was only the latest move by the US to try to force the\nPalestinians to capitulate and give up their claims to an independent state.\n\n\"They wanted us on our knees and they used every trick - internally,\nexternally, regionally - to put pressure on us. We stand tall and we will\nstand tall.\"\n\n_This article has been adapted from its original source._\n\nTags:\n\n",

Furthermore, while this claim implies some sort of wrongdoing on her\npart, no one has offered any information about how she supposedly built her\nalleged fortune.\n\nIn other words, this claim appears to have been conjured out of thin air.\n\nWhile the tweet shown above claimed that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17\nmillion, other socialmediausers have offered differing estimates of her net\nworth:\n\n\n\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancies in this claim is that there is\nno credible evidence for the estimates.\n\nSome social media users pointed to articles published on Walikali and\nGossipgist to support their claim that Yovanovitch’s net worth far exceeded\nher salary. However, just like the above-displayed tweets, these sites offered\nno evidence to support their estimates.\n\nThe articles published on these websites provide some basic biographical\ninformation about the former ambassador to Ukraine. They do not, however,\nprovide any insight into any business dealings or investments that Yovanovitch\nmay have made that could have resulted in a $17 million net worth. Instead,\nthey simply tacked on their estimate ($6 million in both cases) without making\nany attempt to justify that figure.\n\nWe reached out to Walikali and Gossipgist for more information on how they\narrived at their estimates and will update this article if more information\nbecomes available.\n\nIn sum, the claim that Yovanovitch has a net worth of $17 million (or $12\nmillion or $6 million or $3 million) is wholly unsubstantiated. This rumor\nappears to have been made up out of whole cloth in an apparent attempt to\ndiscredit her U.S. House testimony.\n\nDan Evon\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\nThe merger of the big newspaper chains Gannett and GateHouse Media, which\nbecame final Tuesday, will create a “stronger” and “more viable” print and\ndigital news enterprise “with deep local roots and national scale.”\n\nThat’s the optimistic view mouthed by Michael Reed, the CEO of New Media\nInvestment Group, GateHouse’s parent, on Nov. 14 after the deal was approved\nby shareholders of both companies.\n\nOne would hope so, since the news business could use an injection of optimism\nthese days. Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the “new Gannett,” as\nReed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the\nlargest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news\norganizations.\n\nNews industry analyst Ken Doctor\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of\nlocal news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and\nmanagements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough\nto take up the slack.\n\nAdvertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast\nmajority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that\ndigital advertisers don’t much care for.\n\n“Since 2008, there hasn’t been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper\nindustry as a whole,” says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That’s\nproduced a strategy of “continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in\nlocal news.” The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media\ncompanies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time.\n\nThe merged Gannett and GateHouse may not diverge from the trend; Reed has said\nthat he expects to wring as much as $300 million in “synergies” from the\ncombination, but that may be hard to do without more shrinkage in the\nworkforce. Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60\nemployees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it\n“immaterial”) and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred.\n\n\n\nColumn: A vulture firm’s bid for Gannett shows there’s still value in\nnewspapers — for plundering\n\nAmong those who believe that the press provides value for society — especially\nlocal journalism that slaps state and municipal politicians’ hands out of the\npublic cookie jar — Alden Global Capital is a “vulture investing” firm that\nmakes real vultures look good by comparison.\n\nThe private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register,\nDenver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and\nboasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the\npublicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources —\nwith good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about\ntwice the rate of the industry as a whole.\n\n(Alden on Tuesday announced that it had become the largest shareholder of\nTribune, the former owner of The Times, by acquiring the entire 25.2% stake\nheld by Tribune’s former chairman, Michael Ferro, for $13 a share or $117.9\nmillion.)\n\nBut public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can’t\nescape the industry’s economic challenges.\n\nSacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento\nBee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news\nindustry’s coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue\nof $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss\nreflected a write-down of the company’s news assets.\n\nBut the company also reported long-term debt of more than $700 million.\nMcClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn’t have the cash or\ncash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its\npension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by\nthe government’s Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp.\n\nMcClatchy’s parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In\nDecember, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago\nTribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the\nformer owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly\ndemanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune’s largest shareholder.\n\n\n\nThat said, the two companies might have made a good fit, as Tribune’s large-\nmarket publications would have balanced McClatchy’s stable of smaller metro\nnewspapers.\n\nTribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having\npaid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-\nShiong’s purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500\nmillion. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major\nshareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.\n\nIndeed, Doctor asserts that talks have resumed between McClatchy and Tribune.\nBoth companies declined to comment on the assertion.\n\nThe most important question raised by the ostensibly synergistic consolidation\nin the news industry represented by the acquisition spree of firms such as\nAlden and the Gannett-Gatehouse merger is what the owners will do with any\nsavings they extract. For almost any news organization looking to the future,\nthe imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that’s where the\nnews audience has been moving to.\n\nGateHouse hasn’t been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by\nPenelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm’s\npractice after acquiring a newspaper has been to “consolidate copy editing and\npage design” at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty\nreporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. “GateHouse-\nowned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,” Abernathy\nreported.\n\nReed, who will be the merged company’s chairman, told investors of New Media,\nthe GateHouse parent, on Oct. 31 that the merger would allow the company to\nquickly pay down debt and “to return capital to shareholders through\ndividends, in addition to investing for growth that will drive revenues.” It\nshouldn’t escape notice that it’s not always easy to reconcile using cash to\npay shareholder dividends with “investing for growth.”\n\n\n\nThe increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of\nplunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress\nInvestment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as\na major player in the company through an initial public offering and a\nbankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract.\n\nFortress will give up the management contract at the end of 2021, but will\nleave with a payout that New Media investor Leon Cooperman blasted on an\ninvestor conference call as “morally wrong.”\n\n“I know we’re happy to get rid of Fortress,” Cooperman told Reed. “They\nbrought this public in 2014 at $16 a share. The stock is $8.5 and they’re\ngoing to walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars. ... They shouldn’t\neven take the money, given what they’ve done here.” (Cooperman is the\nbillionaire investor who recently tangled with Elizabeth Warren over her\nproposal for a wealth tax.)\n\nPlunder can work as a short-term money-making strategy in an industry that\nremains profitable while tracing a glide path to extinction. “Financial\nplayers like Fortress and Alden are making significant money on the way down,”\nsays Doctor. “They see the way down as close to inevitable.”\n\nIn the news business that’s a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public\ncompanies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have\nimposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on\nphysical delivery — McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all\nits newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles\nonline. But they also have invested in investigative reporting and other\nnational-level efforts, as well as digital initiatives.\n\nAs traditional revenues continue to decline — and at an ever faster pace —\nthose companies find themselves in a vise. Making the transition to digital\nnews requires resources that may be harder to come by. Meanwhile, Doctor says,\nthey’re trying to buy time through shrinkage even as their ultimate\ndestination remains unclear.\n\n“After two more years of this,” Doctor asks, “what kind of products are going\nto be left in local communities that readers feel are worth a digital\nsubscription? What’s your strategy after all the cost-cutting?”\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband of more than 20 years just purchased plane tickets to\nIndia. It’s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in\nbusiness class, while I’m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply\ndoesn’t want to spend it. He’s older and has health concerns and mobility\nissues.\n\nAm I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than\nhis love for me? Or should I be content and happy I’m going to a beautiful\ncountry? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATE\n\nDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a\nbeautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your\npenny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you\nthan he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You\nhave a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either\nsit together or he’ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a\nrestaurant we’ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies’ room and was\nwashing my hands when a waitress I don’t care for came barging in, got in my\nface and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn’t let me out\nof the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling\nme no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\n\nMy husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said\nthat I started it. Another waitress who calls me her “sister” didn’t answer\nthe texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she\nbelieves the waitress, too.\n\nThe restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn’t\ncare. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I’m 74 and was\ntempted to go to the police but didn’t. Now I wish I had pressed charges.\nShould I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\n\nDEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have\nwritten, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and\nfalsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to\nan emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about\nwhat the woman did to you.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The\nHPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our\ngeneration.\n\nA few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if\nher granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had\nasked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have\ngrandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. --\nCONCERNED SISTER\n\nDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don’t\nthink your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was\nasked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that\nher granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually\nactive, which made her defensive.\n\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and\nwas founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

        "articleBody": "hile Anglophiles spent the weekend watching the third season of The Crown on\nNetflix, the real Prince Andrew was busy distancing himself from a more\nsinister style of royal drama.\n\nIn an interview about his friendship with billionaire pedophile and alleged\nsex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, BBC’s Emily Maitlis did an excellent job\npressing Andrew. Maitlis repeatedly demanded how Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II's\nthird child, could be so sure what he was doing on the night of March 10,\nduring which he allegedly raped 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, a victim of\nEpstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring.\n\nAndrew doesn’t remember any raping, but he definitely remembers going to get\npizza that night. \"Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me\nto do,\" he said. \"I remember it weirdly, distinctly.\"\n\nAndrew also spent 45 seconds explaining how he couldn’t have been with\nGiuffre, because she described him as sweating, and at that point in time, he\nhad a medical condition in which he couldn’t sweat.\n\n“Oh, actually? Yes,” he assures himself. “I didn’t sweat at the time.”\n\nBut, to cover his tracks in case the paparazzi catch him sweating, he\nexplained that he can sweat now.\n\nAndrew has no memory of the photograph of himself with Giuffre, either. And if\nthere was any indication of Epstein’s crimes during the years in which they\nwere friends, visiting each other at their respective swanky homes, he simply\ncan’t remember.\n\n“There was no indication, absolutely no indication,” Andrew said. “And if\nthere was, you have to remember that at the time, I was the patron of the\n[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children’s] ‘Full Stop’\ncampaign, so I was close-up with what was going on in those — time about\ngetting rid of abuse to children, so I knew what was, what the things were to\nlook for but I never saw them.”\n\nThe fact that Andrew was sponsoring a campaign against child cruelty doesn’t\nseem like a point in his favor. It seems more like a devastating irony.\n\nAs if all of this hedging wasn't enough to strengthen suspicion that the\naccusations are true, Andrew said he doesn’t regret his relationship with\nEpstein because of \"the opportunities I was given to learn\" about business. In\nother words, who cares if someone is a sex-trafficking pedophile if they can\nteach you a bit about profiting off the stock market?\n\nThe interview should be a nail in the coffin to Andrew’s apparent guilt in\nassociating with and enabling Epstein for so many years.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's done,\" Giuffre said before the interview . \"And I\nhope he comes clean about it.\"\n\nAndrew hasn’t come clean about anything, but his flustered and incoherent\ndenials speak volumes. Let’s hope we see more of Epstein’s associates — from\npoliticians such as Bill Clinton and President Trump to media figures such as\nKatie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, and Chelsea Handler — grilled about their\nconnections with him.\n\nUnfortunately, Andrew’s interview only appears to have happened thanks to his\npublicist quitting . After this, Epstein’s powerful friends will be more\ncareful, and no one else will be so foolish as to accidentally admit what\nappears to be guilt.\n\n",

All but four have\nnow been released.\n\nPlague can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of people infected if not treated\npromptly.\n\nThe last major known outbreak in China was in 2009, when several people died\nin the town of Ziketan in Qinghai province on the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nIn May this year, travellers were left stranded in Mongolia after an outbreak\nof deadly bubonic plague killed a couple after they ate an infected Marmot.\n\nAuthorities in western Mongolia, which is close to the Russian frontier,\ninstituted a quarantine to prevent the disease from spreading.\n\nAmerican, Dutch, German, Swedish, Swiss, and South Korean tourists were\nmarooned in Uglii as a result.\n\n### How is the plague spread?\n\nPlague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis - a bacteria usually found in\nsmall mammals and their fleas.\n\nThose infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an incubaction\nperiod of one-to-seven days, says the World Health Organization.\n\nSymptoms include a sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, along\nwith weakness and vomiting.\n\nThe two main forms of plague infection are bubonic and pneumonic - where\nbubonic plague has spread to the lungs.\n\nBubonic is the most common form and is where people develop painful swollen\nlymph nodes, or 'buboes'.\n\nAt advanced stages of the infection, inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open\nsores filled with pus.\n\nPlague is transmitted between animals and humans; by the bite of infected\nfleas; direct contact with infected tissues; and inhalation of infected\nrespiratory droplets.\n\nThose suffering from bubonic plague have a 30-60 per cent chance of dying from\nthe disease.\n\nUntreated pneumonic plague is \"always fatal\", says WHO.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases reported worldwide, including 584\ndeaths.\n\nHistorically, plague was responsible for widespread pandemics with high\nmortality.\n\nIt was known as the \"Black Death\" during the fourteenth century, causing more\nthan 50 million deaths in Europe.\n\nNowadays, plague is easily treated with antibiotics.\n\n### Most read in world news\n\n",

Instead, they\nlost 24-17.\n\n“We talked all along about everything we wanted was still in front of us,”\nLynn said, via the Los Angeles Times. “Yes, we needed to win this game today.\nI felt like if we could have won this game today and won out, we could control\nour own destiny. But now, obviously, I don’t feel that way. I still think we\nhave enough to win next week and beyond that, but we probably are going to\nneed some help.”\n\nAt 4-7, including 2-6 in the AFC and 0-3 in AFC West, the Chargers would\nprobably not make the playoffs even if they win out. And given the way they’ve\nplayed so far and the three games remaining against teams with winning\nrecords, there’s no reason to think they’ll win out. Lynn is right: The\nChargers needed to win that game.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "## What is the value of drugs that come to the U.S. border?\n\nIn October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near\nMcAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border\nsecurity, including more border patrol agents.\n\nA major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley\nsaid, is the flow of drugs into the country.\n\nBorder agents \"say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is\ncoming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer,\nthe Wheeling News-Register.\n\nIs this number correct? It’s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he\nappears to be in the ballpark.\n\nWe’ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns\ndrugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming\nthrough undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\n\nAs a result, in this fact-check, we’ll interpret McKinley’s comment to refer\nto the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley’s office did not provide\nPolitiFact with further information.)\n\nHere’s the most recent data on drug seizures — cocaine, heroin, marijuana,\nmethamphetamine, and fentanyl — from Customs and Border Protection.\n\n\n\nThe official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection\nmeasures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So\nto approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\n\nFor cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October\n2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data\nfrom the University of Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We\ndecided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange\nCounty, Calif., sheriff’s office in calculating the size of a bust in October\n2019.\n\nThe following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019\nseizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\n\n\n\nOnce you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2\nmillion per week.\n\nThat’s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it’s in the\nballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\n\n\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and\ncertainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies\nat the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\n\nWe should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and\nmethamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It’s unclear\nhow pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for\nColorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as\na whole.\n\nAnother caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the\nseizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian\nborder. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico\n\"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that\n\"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in\nthe United States.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nMcKinley said that \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\"\n\nIf you interpret his statement to mean how much is reaching the border and is\nseized there, the available federal, state and local data puts the figure at\nabout $44 million. That’s smaller than what McKinley said, but his number is a\nreasonable approximation given the uncertainty stemming from value\nfluctuations and other limitations of the data.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\n### Our Sources\n\nThe Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register, \"Rep. David McKinley Calls for\nIncrease in Border Patrol Agent Ranks,\" Oct. 13, 2019\n\nCustoms and Border Protection, \"U.S. Border Patrol Nationwide Drug Seizures,\"\naccessed Nov. 13, 2019\n\nU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" 2018\n\nMarijuana Policy Group and the Leeds School of Business at the University of\nColorado-Boulder, \"Market Size and Demand for Marijuana in Colorado,\" 2017\nmarket update\n\nOrange County Register, \"Massive fentanyl bust highlights the opioid’s fast-\ngrowing threat in Orange County, authorities say,\" Oct. 18, 2019\n\nOffice of National Drug Control Policy, \"What America’s Users Spend on Illegal\nDrugs: 2000-2010,\" February 2014\n\nEmail interview with Jonathan P.

Dealers last year sold 303,417 new\nvehicles, up 4 percent from the previous year, according to InfoNation.\n\n“People are a little more cautious in regards to purchasing vehicles,”\nInfoNation President Dan McDowell said, adding, “2019 is just not as strong as\n2018.”\n\n**On HoustonChronicle.com:** Car sales plunge nearly 17 percent in August\n\nThe sales slump comes even as the average interest rate on a new vehicle loan\nstayed below 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month. The annual percentage\nrate on new financed vehicles averaged 5.7 percent in October, down from 6.2\npercent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com, a California-based\nautomobile data firm.\n\nIndustry experts expect interest rates to remain low as automakers sweeten\ndeals to draw buyers and clear out old inventory toward the end of the year.\nThe Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a\nquarter-point last month should keep auto interest rates low for the remainder\nof the year.\n\n“The end of the calendar year is a popular time for expensive vehicle\npurchases,\" Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of industry\nanalysis, said in a statement. \"Shoppers in the market for a large truck or\nSUV, or a new luxury vehicle, can look forward to taking advantage of lower\nfinancing rates as a bit of an early holiday gift.\"\n\n**On HoustonChronicle.com:**\n\nDespite lower interest rates and financing deals, new car prices are climbing.\nThe average retail price of a new vehicle sold locally in October was $39,014,\nup from $38,373 a year ago and from $34,410 in October 2015.\n\nThe average price of a new truck or SUV sold in October was $41,640 while the\naverage price for a new sedan was $31,627, according to InfoNation. New\ninfotainment and safety technology, such as lane changing alerts, backup\ncameras, sutomatic braking and self-parking features, have pushed prices up,\nMcDowell said.\n\nHouston-area fleet sales -- new vehicles sold to corporations and governments\n-- began trending upwards last month, representing 14.6 percent of all vehicle\nsales in October. Although fleet sales were up from 13.2 percent in September,\nit’s still down from the March high of 21.8 percent and the prior 12-month\naverage of 15.2 percent.\n\nNationally, dealers sold nearly 17.3 million new vehicles last year, an\nincrease of just 0.3 percent from 2017.

        "articleBody": "\n\nI am a writer, journalist, professor, systems modeler, computational and\ndigital health expert, avocado-eater, and entrepreneur, not always in that\norder.\n\nThe Corrs’ song “Breathless” probably doesn’t refer to a duvet. However, it\nwas this type of fluffy bedding that left a man not only breathless but with a\nserious lung condition, according to a case report published in the journal\n_BMJ Case Reports_.\n\nWondering how something so soft and so comfortable could make you sick and\neven eventually be life-threatening? Well, in the words of the Corrs, go on,\ngo on. This case report may leave you breathless.\n\nFor the case report, Patrick Liu-Shiu-Cheong of Victoria Hospital and Chris\nRuiWen Kuo, Struan WA Wilkie, and Owen Dempsey of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary\nin the UK told the tale of a 43-year-old man who saw his doctor in November\n2016 after three months of feeling very tired and breathless. His doctor\ninitially thought that the man had a lower respiratory tract infection but\ncontrary to the Howard Jones song, things didn’t get better afterwards. In\nfact, in December 2016, the man returned with worsening breathlessness to the\npoint where he couldn’t walk from one room to another without getting out of\nbreath.\n\nHere is how bad things got in the words of the patient: “Two months after the\nonset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few\nminutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out. Going upstairs\nto bed was a 30 min activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and\nthen needed to sit and rest. I was signed off work and spent most of the time\nasleep (day and night).”\n\nAt first glance, the man didn’t have any obvious reasons to be so breathless.\nHe wasn’t a smoker. His workplace didn’t expose him to anything unusual. His\nmain hobby was playing guitar and saxophone for a band, and nothing indicated\nthat he was sticking either of these instruments up his nostrils.\n\nAh, but one piece of history proved to be important: he had recently\n“acquired” both a feather duvet and feather pillows. Why was this relevant? Go\non, go on.\n\nBreathing tests demonstrated that his lungs could not hold or breathe out as\nmuch air as normal. Also, oxygen and carbon dioxide weren’t moving as well\nbetween his lungs and his blood vessels as they should.\n\nA CT of his chest revealed a “ground glass” pattern in both of his lungs. Some\nlymph nodes in his chest were somewhat enlarged as well. These findings were\nconsistent with a condition called HP. No, not the computer manufacturer but\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n\nHP is basically a severe allergic reaction in your lungs. It occurs when your\nlungs generate an immune reaction to some substance that you continue to\nbreathe in over a period of time. This substance can be dust, mold, bird\ndroppings, or a range of other things, including, duvet roll please, feathers.\nWhen the offending substance is feathers in a duvet, HP is called “feather\nduvet lung.” When it is feathers on a bird, the term often used is “bird\nfancier’s lung.” When HP occurs in a person breeding pigeons, it is called\n“pigeon breeder’s lung.” If the feathers were on a human in a giant chicken\ncostume, well that doesn’t occur often enough to have its own name.\n\nWait there’s more. Breathing in mold from hay or grain can lead to what’s\ncalled “farmer's lung,” not to be confused with a farmer’s tan. “Humidifier\nlung” may result from fungus growing in, guess what, humidifiers or some\nsimilar air exchange device like an air conditioner. Then there is “hot tub\nlung,” which may sound a bit sexy, but totally isn’t. The bacteria in hot tubs\ncan travel through the water vapor into your nose and lungs. Yeah, it’s not\nalways good if what’s in a hot tub makes you breathless.\n\nThe doctor subsequently prescribed the man in the case report steroids to calm\nthe reaction and inflammation in his lungs and told him to get rid of the\nfeather duvet and pillows. As a safeguard, the man also cleaned his dwelling\nof mold. According to the man, the steroids “had a transformative effect\nwithin 2 days. At the same time, having assumed that a possible cause of the\nallergy was feather bedding, I replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.”\n\nEventually, everything turned to normal for the man. As he related, “the\ncourse of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual\nreduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them\ncompletely. My oxygen saturation level nowadays is regularly 97%–98% which I\nunderstand to be normal for someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns\nsince recovering. It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much\nas it was before.”\n\nFortunately, doctors caught his condition early enough to reverse the\ninflammation. If HP continues unchecked for too long, lung scarring can\nresult. Such damage, called pulmonary fibrosis, is permanent and irreversible.\nNot surprisingly pulmonary fibrosis can interfere with your ability to breathe\nand exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. If it gets bad enough, it can be life\nthreatening because you gotta be able to breathe to live.\n\nSo, if something is leaving you breathless and it’s not someone whom you\nfancy, you may want to check your surroundings for anything that may causing\nan allergic reaction in your lungs. Could it be from your feathering your nest\nor your cap or anything else? It could also be your hot tub, your air\nconditioner, or the many bales of hay that you keep in your bedroom. Or\nperhaps it’s the pigeons that you are breeding by the dozens in your kitchen.\n\nBefore you get too paranoid about your bedding, your air conditioner, or the\nflocks of pigeons inside your house, keep in mind that conditions like\n“feather duvet lung” are still relatively uncommon. That’s why this case\nbecame a case report. Regardless, take any chronic breathlessness that you may\nhave seriously and see your doctor before you get to a point where after even\nthe slightest touch, you feel weak.\n\nFollow me on\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Two hostages — an American and an Australian — who had been held by the\nTaliban in Afghanistan since 2016 were released Tuesday in a prisoner swap for\nthree high-ranking insurgents.\n\nAmerican Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks, both professors at the\nAmerican University of Kabul, were handed over to US ­forces in the country’s\nsouthern Zabul province, an insurgent source told Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe men were flown out of the region on US choppers, according to a local\npolice source. Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed\nthree Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar.\n\nBoth sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in\nstalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul\ngovernment and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group’s\n18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US\ntroops.\n\nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the\nTaliban’s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla\ninsurgent group’s Haqqani network.\n\nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a\npolitical office, according to a Taliban representative.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages “give[s] us\nhope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United\nStates stands ready to support.\n\n“We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible\nand costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a\npolitical settlement.”\n\nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their\nordeal. “We pray for the full recovery of both men,” said White House Press\nSecretary Stephanie Grisham. “We thank the Afghan government for its actions,\nin the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.”\n\nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last\nweek, he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to\nthe front line.\n\nHe also said he hoped the swap would “pave the way” for unofficial direct\ntalks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to\nnegotiate peace with Kabul.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, “We are\nprofoundly pleased and relieved” at the hostages’ release, adding that Weeks’\nfamily had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\n\nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart\nof Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two\nvideos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale\nand gaunt.\n\nBoth men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their\ngovernments to help in their release — but it’s impossible to know whether\nthey were forced to speak.\n\nUS officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the\nhostages at one point that failed to find the hostages.\n\nWashington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement\nfor US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal\nwhen President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Earlier this year, Lexus revealed the LC Convertible Concept, essentially an\nopen-top version of the gorgeous LC 500 grand tourer. At the time, Lexus\ncalled the vehicle a concept despite looking ready to hit showrooms and\nstreets worldwide.\n\nNow, at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, the Japanese luxury marque has finally\npulled the covers off the production model 2020 LC 500 Convertible.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the LC 500 Convertible looks largely similar to the LC\nConvertible Concept previewed in January. Most of the design cues has simply\nbeen carried over. However, it seems the more stylish wheels on the Concept\nappears to have been ditched in favor of the standard units fitted on the\nCoupe.\n\nStyling-wise, the biggest difference between the Convertible and the standard\nLC 500 would be the lack of a roof and a revised rear deck. In place of a\nfixed metal roof and the large backglass is a retractable fabric soft top.\nLexus engineers have hidden the frame underneath the material so that it won’t\nbe seen with the roof in place. No doubt the LC 500 Convertible looks very\nstylish with the roof down. However, some might find it’s roofline a bit\nstrange with the soft-top roof up.\n\nShould the weather take a turn for the worse, drivers can operate the folding\nsoft-top to close in just 16 seconds at speeds at up to 50 km/h. Meanwhile, it\njust takes 15 seconds to fold the roof down and give occupant open-air\nfreshness. The air-conditioning system also automatically adjusts cabin\ntemperature whether the top is up or down. The rest of the cabin has simply\nbeen carried over from the coupe.\n\nIn order to make up for the lack of a roof, Lexus Project Manager Fumihiko\nHazama shared with AutoIndustriya.com that they have improved chassis rigidity\nby adding x-braces. The front suspension has also been revised in order to\nreduce unsprung weight. At the rear, the suspension brace has been relocated\nand reshaped in order to improve structural rigidity.\n\nUnder the hood, it’s the same 5.0-liter V8 engine which produces 471\nhorsepower and 540 Nm of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a\n10-speed automatic transmission. To hear the V8 better, a pipe channels engine\nnoise into the cabin.\n\nThe Lexus LC 500 Convertible will go on sale in summer 2020. Considering how\nLexus Philippines offers almost all Lexus models locally, it's possible the\nLC500 Convertible could arrive in the future.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "McDonald joins Tom Johnston, Patrick Simmons, and John McFee onstage in\nNashville for a surprise performance and tour announce\n\nBy\n\nThe Doobie Brothers will unite with former frontman Michael McDonald for a\n2020 North American tour celebrating the band’s 50th anniversary.\n\nSinger-guitarists Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons, singer-keyboardist\nMcDonald, and multi-instrumentalist John McFee will tour together for the\nfirst time in nearly 25 years during the trek, which kicks off June 9th in\nWest Palm Beach, Florida, and concludes October 10th in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Doobie Brothers announced the 30-date jaunt while closing out their\nNovember 18th concert at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, which featured\nfull-LP performances of 1972’s _Toulouse Street_ and 1973’s _The Captain and\nMe_. McDonald came out during the encore for a surprise version of their\nsingle “Takin’ It to the Streets,” the title track of their 1976 album, the\nfirst with McDonald in the lineup.\n\nFollowing a performance of their sing-along jam “Black Water,” Simmons teed up\nMcDonald’s cameo. “You might remember him from, well, he has his own band\nthese days,” he said. “But you might remember him from his band, the Doobie\nBrothers — Mr. Michael McDonald.”\n\nDressed in black pants, an untucked black shirt, and glasses, the white-haired\nMcDonald took his place at a keyboard at the front of the stage and began the\nintro to “Takin’ It to the Streets.” The reaction from the crowd, a mix of\nboomers and nostalgia-loving Gen-X’ers, was rapturous and they called for more\neven as the lights came up signaling the official end of the night.\n\nTickets for the 50th anniversary tour go on sale to the general public\nstarting Friday, December 6th, at 10 a.m. local time via Live Nation.\n\n“We’re truly excited about our 50th Anniversary Tour, as it’s a celebration of\nthe band’s entire history,” Johnston said in a statement. “We’ll be performing\nsongs from our full catalog, as well as new music.”\n\nMcDonald joined the band in 1975 and initially remained in the lineup until\n1982, appearing on four albums and hit singles like 1978’s “What a Fool\nBelieves.” He later performed with the band on multiple occasions.\n\nThe band’s current tour continues November 19th in Greenville, South Carolina;\nafter a break later that month, the schedule picks up February 7th in Las\nVegas.\n\n**The Doobie Brothers Tour Dates**\n\nJune 9 – West Palm Beach, FL @ Coral Sky Amphitheatre\n\nJune 10 – Tampa, FL @ MIDFLORIDA Credit Union Amphitheatre\n\nJune 14 – Alpharetta, GA @ Ameris Bank Amphitheatre (Formerly Verizon\nAmphitheatre)\n\nJune 17 – Nashville, TN @ Bridgestone Arena\n\nJune 19 – Charlotte, NC @ PNC Music Pavilion\n\nJune 20 – Raleigh, NC @ Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek\n\nJune 23 – Virginia Beach, VA @ Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater at\nVirginia Beach\n\nJune 24 – Bristow, VA @ Jiffy Lube Live\n\nJune 26 – Allentown, PA @ PPL Center\n\nJune 27 – Camden, NJ @ BB&T; Pavilion\n\nJune 29 – Holmdel, NJ @ PNC Bank Arts Center\n\nJune 30 – Wantagh, NY @ Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater\n\nJuly 2 – Uncasville, CT @ Mohegan Sun Arena\n\nJuly 3 – Mansfield, MA @ Xfinity Center\n\nJuly 19 – Toronto, ON @ Budweiser Stage\n\nJuly 22 – Cuyahoga Falls, OH @ Blossom Music Center\n\nJuly 26 – Saratoga Springs, NY @ Saratoga Performing Arts Center\n\nJuly 30 – Noblesville, IN @ Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center\n\nAugust 2 – Clarkston, MI @ DTE Energy Music Theatre\n\nAugust 4 – Cincinnati, OH @ Riverbend Music Center\n\nAugust 8 – Tinley Park, IL @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre – Chicago\n\nAugust 14 – St. Louis, MO @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre – St. Louis\n\nAugust 30 – Denver, CO @ Pepsi Center\n\nSeptember 2 – Salt Lake City, UT @ USANA Amphitheatre\n\nSeptember 5 – Seattle, WA @ White River Amphitheatre\n\nSeptember 12 – Mountain View, CA @ Shoreline Amphitheatre\n\nSeptember 18 – Los Angeles, CA @ The Forum\n\nOctober 3 – Phoenix, AZ @ Ak-Chin Pavilion\n\nOctober 9 – Irving, TX @ Toyota Music Factory\n\nOctober 10 – Houston, TX @ The Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion\n\n_Additional reporting by Joseph Hudak_\n\n",

After all, we\nshould be humble and give the driver some amount of credit, before we decide\nthat we know better than them and say that they are stupidly doing something\nthat’s not in their own best interest.\n\nLogically, there must be some speed at which it’s no longer better (in terms\nof overall utility) to be slower — if not, the speed limit would be 1 MPH. Are\nwe sure that those buses are currently travelling above that ideal speed?\n\n**Gary M** on September 17, 2018 at 8:50 pm said:\n\nHave you written anything about the trade-off between giving now vs investing\nthe money and giving in the future?\n\nIn particular it seems like effective altruism research is still improving\nquickly, so we might be able to give more effectively in the future.\n\n**Catherine (GiveWell)** on September 19, 2018 at 12:48 pm said:\n\nHi Alex,\n\nOur best guess is that any effects on vehicle speed are fairly small. We have\nlimited data on this question; the only information we have is from the 2015\nrandomized controlled trial (RCT). We write in our report on Zusha!:\n\nReductions in average speed at levels similar to that referenced above are\nsmall enough that we don’t model the disutility. That said, this study raises\nthe question of the mechanism by which accidents are reduced, if speeds don’t\nchange. Our question about the mechanism by which the reduction in accidents\noccurred is one of our key uncertainties about the program, and is one of the\nfactors that led us to discount our best-guess effect of the intervention more\nthan for most programs with RCTs we’ve looked at.\n\n**Catherine (GiveWell)** on September 20, 2018 at 10:07 am said:\n\nHi Gary,\n\nWe detailed several considerations related to giving now versus later in this\n2011 blog post.\n\nWe see the following general arguments in favor of giving now and giving\nlater.\n\nIn favor of giving now:\n\n* It may become less cost-effective to help people in the future, due to general economic development and improvements in living conditions, and so some of the best opportunities to save or improve a life today may not exist in the future.\n\n* Accomplishing good today may “earn interest,” by empowering people and positioning them to help others in the future.\n\nIn favor of giving later:\n\n* We might find more cost-effective programs in the future, through our Incubation Grants program or by researching and reviewing new areas, such as policy advocacy.\n\n* An opportunity that looks good now could look worse in the future (for example, because we learn new information or because it runs out of room for more funding).\n\nOn balance, our best guess is that the benefits of giving now are likely to\noutweigh the benefits of giving later, although we have a high degree of\nuncertainty around this. Some of the additional factors raised in the 2011\nblog post also point in favor of giving now, such as providing an incentive to\nthink carefully about where to give each year and helping charities plan\naround your gifts.\n\nIn addition, here are some resources outside of GiveWell from the effective\naltruism community that may be of interest in thinking about this question:\n\n* Effective Altruism Forum roundup of writings on this topic\n\n* 2015 Global Priorities Project write-up, with flowchart\n\n**Mohammad** on September 29, 2018 at 12:16 am said:\n\nHi,\n\nI recently stumbled upon this old blog post\n(https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2012/12/some-general-concerns-about-\ngivewell/) by William MacAskill and was very interested in this remark:\n\n“GoodVentures’ endowment could easily use up the room for more funding at\nGiveWell’s top charities. So it raises the question why GoodVentures doesn’t\ndonate to GiveWell’s top charities: even if not exhausting their room for more\nfunding, at least using up a considerable proportion of it. The most plausible\nexplanation in my mind is that GiveWell thinks that GoodVentures can better\nspend its money at a later date after further research. In which case, it’s\nhard to see why individual donors shouldn’t save and donate later, or even try\nto give to GoodVentures. Perhaps that’s wrong, but it’s worthy of discussion.”\n\nI wanted to know if there had been any further discussion on it by GiveWell or\nothers. If there hasn’t, could GiveWell give a response now? Is the reason\nGoodVentures is not exhausting its funds to close these gaps every year\nbecause they are holding out for a future opportunity? Or is it to\nstrategically leave behind some funding gaps so as to entice individiual\ndonors like myself who are attracted to effectiveness, and thus in the grand\nscheme of things there will have been moved a greater sum of money in\ntotality?\n\n**Olivia (GiveWell)** on October 4, 2018 at 10:58 am said:\n\nHi Mohammad,\n\nThanks for your question.\n\nGood Ventures is a large charitable foundation which works closely with\nGiveWell, although the two organizations are distinct from one another. Good\nVentures sets its overall grantmaking budget independent from GiveWell,\naccording to its own cause prioritization. In 2017, Good Ventures’ giving to\nGiveWell’s top charities derived from its assumption that, in the long run,\n10% of its total available capital would go to “straightforward charity” (as\nopposed to more speculative causes or worldviews), expected to align with\nGiveWell’s research and recommendations. You can read about the reasoning for\nGood Ventures choosing 10% in detail here.\n\nGiveWell was involved in discussions with Good Ventures about the allocation\nof this pool of its funding in 2017, but, as we noted in our blog post\nannouncing our updated top charities, “the amount [Good Ventures gave to our\nrecommended charities] was based on discussions about how to allocate funding\nacross time and across cause areas. It was not set based on the total size of\ntop charities’ funding gaps or the projection of what others would give.”\n\n**Charles Pritchard** on October 27, 2018 at 8:34 pm said:\n\nHave there been any further discussions or analyses performed in relation to\nthe Partners in Health programs following the 2012 update?\n\nhttps://www.givewell.org/international/charities/PIH\n\n**Catherine (GiveWell)** on October 29, 2018 at 12:06 pm said:\n\nHi Charles,\n\nWe have not prioritized further investigation into Partners in Health since\nour 2012 review was published.\n\nComments are closed.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "October 9, 2018 | by Olivia Larsen\n\nIn July 2018, we recommended a $5.1 million grant to Evidence Action Beta to\ncreate a program dedicated to developing potential GiveWell top charities by\nprototyping, testing, and scaling programs which have the potential to be\nhighly impactful and cost-effective.\n\nThis grant was made as part of GiveWell’s Incubation Grants program, which\naims to support potential future GiveWell top charities and to help grow the\npipeline of organizations we can consider for a recommendation. Funding for\nIncubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we\nwork closely.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis post will discuss the following:\n\n* Why Evidence Action Beta is promising. (\n\nMore\n\n* )\n\n* Risks we see with this Incubation Grant. (\n\nMore\n\n* )\n\n* Our plans for following Evidence Action Beta’s work going forward. (\n\nMore\n\n* )\n\n### Incubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\n\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\n\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\n\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator\nbecause of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-\nquality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta’s parent organization, Evidence\nAction, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No\nLean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water).\n\n#### Modeling cost-effectiveness\n\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made\nexplicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this\ngrant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this\nsection, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant’s\ncost-effectiveness.\n\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top\ncharities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than\nalternatives could.\n\nThis could occur:\n\n* if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\n\n* if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities—in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities’ funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities’ funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional\n\nroom for more funding\n\n* at a similarly cost-effective level.\n\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders\nto allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may\ncreate programs that GiveWell doesn’t direct funding to but others do. If\nthese new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would\nhave otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by\ncausing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never\nrecommends funding to the new programs directly.\n\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not\nbecause we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and\ncommunicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a\n55% chance that Evidence Action Beta’s incubator leads to a new top charity by\nDecember 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to\nwhich we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the\ngrant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts\nwe made surrounding this grant, see here.)\n\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above\nin our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential\nupside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could\nchange substantially with additional research.\n\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as\ncash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly\nuncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-\neffectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-\neffective as cash transfers.\n\n### Risks to the success of the grant\n\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\n\n* Few programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell’s\n\n2017 top charities\n\n* , or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\n\n* We expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate\n\npolicy opportunities\n\n* , end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\n\n### Going forward\n\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we\nmight contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in\nthe future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing\npartnership and follow this work closely.\n\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.\n\n**Jamie Cassidy** on November 15, 2018 at 10:12 am said:\n\nI am so pumped about this!

        "articleBody": "The government has unveiled a plan to help the PV industry reduce the cost of\nsolar panels from around $0.23/W to $0.10/W by 2030. The plan also aims to\nreach module efficiencies of around 24% – up to 35% for multi-junction cells –\nby the end of the next decade.November 20, 2019Emiliano Bellini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) has unveiled a\nplan to help the PV industry further reduce the costs of solar module\ntechnology and to increase product efficiency.\n\nThe initiative is part of the Fourth Energy Technology Development Plan and\nRoadmap, submitted to Korean renewable energy industry representatives this\nweek. The plan includes actions to raise electromobility rates, reduce coal-\nfired fine dusts by 90%, improve nuclear safety and increase the scale of wind\npower projects, among other measures.\n\nSixteen energy technology priorities identified by MOTIE in the roadmap\ninclude a reduction in solar module costs from around $0.23/W today to $0.10\nby 2030, helped by unspecified research and development investment. As a way\nof rough comparison, the SunShot Initiative launched by the U.S. government in\n2011 aims to reduce the price of the solar electricity generated by large\nscale projects to $0.03/kWh by 2030. In September 2017, the Department of\nEnergy announced the $0.06/kWh benchmark of that ambition had been achieved\nthree years early.\n\n**Module efficiency**\n\nThe South Korean government also wants to help manufacturers increase solar\nmodule efficiency from around 20% now to 24% by the end of the next decade.\nSeoul expects PV cell producers to increase the average efficiency of multi-\njunction devices from 23% to 35%.\n\nNo details were provided on how the industrial and technological targets would\nbe achieved.\n\nThe plan appears consistent with another announced by MOTIE in March, which\naimed to introduce carbon footprint certification rules, minimum efficiency\nlevels and industrial standards for solar and wind power. Those planned\nguidelines are yet to see the light of day.\n\n### Popular content\n\n**Domestic industry**\n\nA recent report by the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power\nSystems Program stated the South Korean solar module industry had an annual\nproduction capacity of around 8.69 GW at the end of 2017. Hanwha Q Cells had\n3.7 GW of cell capacity and the same volume of module operations at that point\nand LG Electronics had 3 GW of output, also evenly split between cells and\nmodules. A further 17 manufacturers, according to the report, had production\noperations ranging from 30-600 MW.\n\nHowever, the reduction in demand seen after Beijing attempted to rein in\npublic solar subsidies at the end of May last year ensures some of that 8.69\nGW of Korean production lines may have since been idled or closed altogether.\n\nSouth Korea also hosts several polysilicon manufacturers, including the OCI\nGroup and Hanwha Q Cells parent Hanwha Group. That industry too is suffering\nfrom oversupply and anti-dumping duties on polysilicon imports by the Chinese\ngovernment since July 2013.\n\nDespite the manufacturing setbacks introduced by its regional neighbor and\nsolar giant, South Korea is seeing stronger than ever solar project\ndeployment. According to data released by MOTIE in August, newly installed\ncapacity for the first seven months of the year reached 1.64 GW and Seoul\nplans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. That ambitious target is expected\nto be achieved with giant solar parks such as a recently announced 2.1 GW\nfloating solar project and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array planned in the\nSaemangeum area and announced by president Moon Jae-in a year ago.\n\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

        "articleBody": "Breaking with decades of United States policy favoring free trade, President\nDonald Trump has pursued an agenda favoring tariffs as weapons in a widening\ntrade war.\n\n\"We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great\nbetrayal is over,\" Trump said at a rally in Monroe, La., on Nov. 6, 2019.\n\"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we're taking in billions\nand billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\"\n\nBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more\ncompetitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the\nthinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better.\nThose workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread\nthose dollars around the economy more broadly.\n\nTariffs have also strengthened the United States’ leverage after massive job\nlosses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the\nAlliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of\nTrump’s tariff decisions.\n\nMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary\nvictims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while\ntariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across\nthe economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any\nslowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the\nbroader U.S. economy.\n\n\"As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\" said Lawrence White, a\nprofessor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. \"Tariffs, like\nany tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the\ntrading relationship poorer — not richer.\"\n\nStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger\nfraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse\nthan more affluent Americans do.\n\nThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the\nUnited States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the\nworld.\n\nWho pays the cost of a tariff?\n\nWhen the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn’t foreign exporters that\nmake the payment. The importers do, and they’re usually U.S. companies.\n\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S.\nCustoms and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a\nU.S. importer — say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban\nInstitute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written. \"The Chinese\ngovernment pays nothing.\"\n\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of\ntheir shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don’t pay\ntheir amount by that date are sent a new bill.\n\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable\nrather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are\nhigh enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S.\nconsumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for\nInternational Economics.\n\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are\nused to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price\nincreases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It’s possible that\nU.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a\nsuitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower\nquality.\n\nDon’t tariffs produce revenue?\n\nRevenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through\nJune 30, 2019.\n\nThat’s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs.\nFor context, that’s less than 2% of annual federal revenues.\n\nMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by\nretaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two\nyears.\n\nHow big an impact have the Trump tariffs had overall?\n\nAs we’ve noted, a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research,\na London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods,\n\"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a\nreduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\n\nSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era\ntariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by\n2020. If that holds up, that would work out to a $75.3 billion dollar hit on\neconomic growth, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political\nscientist who studies U.S.-Canada trade.\n\nOther estimates are in the same ballpark. The conservative-leaning Tax\nFoundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump\nadministration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while\nlowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent\njobs.\n\nWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too.\nFacing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer\nChinese goods, thereby hurting China’s gross domestic product.\n\nWhat tariffs has the United States imposed?\n\nIt started with washing machines and solar panels in February 2018, followed\nby steel and aluminum in March 2018.\n\nChina-specific tariffs took effect in July 2018, primarily covering machinery,\nfollowed by additional tariffs on China in August 2018 that covered plastics,\nmore machinery, and electrical equipment.\n\nThe first big expansion into consumer goods from China came in September 2018,\naffecting home goods, electronics, furniture, backpacks, and other goods.\nTariffs on Chinese goods were increased from 10% to 25% in May 2019, and the\nlist of impacted goods expanded in September 2019 to cover some clothes,\nshoes, televisions and Bluetooth devices.\n\nTariffs have also been imposed on imports from the European Union, including\nmany food products.\n\n\"The overall impact is now over $4 billion per month in extra tariffs on a\nwide range of goods,\" said Daniel Anthony, vice president of the Trade\nPartnership, a trade-focused consulting firm in Washington.\n\nWhat are the major products or sectors that have suffered negative impacts\nfrom tariffs?\n\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers.\n\nU.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from\n$19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau\nFederation. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the\nfirst half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. (Bad weather and other factors may\nhave had an impact as well.)\n\nIn the meantime, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker\nWinnebago are among retailers thatsaid they raised prices as a result of the\ntariffs.\n\nComputers and electronic devices have seen impacts, too, said Mary E. Lovely,\na Syracuse University economist. \"About 36% of imports from China to the U.S.\nare computers and electronic devices,\" she said.\n\nAnd U.S. imports of \"intermediate goods\" from China, such as motors, pumps,\nand semiconductors, have seen price increases, harming U.S. producers. \"When\nthe price of these inputs go up, U.S. businesses find it harder to compete\nagainst non-U.S. competitors, even in the U.S. market,\" Lovely said.\n\nCongressional Budget Office, \"The Effects of Tariffs and Trade Barriers in\nCBO’s Projections,\" Aug. 22, 2019\n\nTax Foundation, \"Tracking the Economic Impact of U.S. Tariffs and Retaliatory\nActions,\" May 31, 2019\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics, \"The Cost of Another US-China\nNo-Deal Deal,\" Oct. 15, 2019\n\nFederal Reserve Board, \"Beige Book,\" Oct. 16, 2019\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, \"Inflationary Effects of Trade Disputes\nwith China,\" Feb. 25, 2019\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, CPI historical data, accessed Nov. 5, 2019\n\nCNN, \"China exempts US soybeans and pork from tariffs,\" Sept. 13, 2019\n\nWall Street Journal, \"U.S. Collected $63 Billion in Tariffs Through June,\"\nAug. 7, 2019\n\nPolitiFact, \"Donald Trump says tariffs will make America rich again.\nEconomists disagree,\" Dec. 17, 2018\n\nPolitiFact, \"In shot at Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is correct about\ntariffs' role in Great Depression,\" June 6, 2016\n\nPolitiFact, \"Who pays for US tariffs on Chinese goods?

The layoffs are part of an effort by the\nstruggling office-space company to cut costs, close ancillary businesses and\nnarrow its offering to subletting office space.\n\n\n\nWeWork chairman Marcelo Claure (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn a company email sent by chairman Marcelo Claure, employees were told that\nlayoffs will begin this week in the U.S., and that a planned all-hands meeting\nwill be postponed from Tuesday to Friday, where Claure will present the\ncompany’s five-year plan.\n\n“In the areas of the business that do not directly support our core business\ngoals, we have to make some necessary job eliminations,” Claure said in the\nemail, which was seen by _The Real Deal_. “We are going to eliminate and scale\nback certain functions and responsibilities, which will increase efficiency\nand also accountability.”\n\nA person familiar with the matter told _TRD_ that employees in the legal and\nhuman resources departments will begin receiving notice Monday.\n\nWeWork declined to comment.\n\nWeWork employees have waited weeks to hear notice of the layoffs, since the\ncompany abandoned plans for an IPO and had its valuation slashed from $47\nbillion to $8 billion. After CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann left the company\nin October, SoftBank, its largest investor, committed to a $9.5 billion\nlifeline to bail out the company, and installed a Claure to implement a\nturnaround strategy.\n\nIn sum, more than 4,000 people are expected to receive notice in the coming\nweeks, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n\nThose include 1,000 maintenance workers who have been informed that their\nemployment will be terminated on Dec. 9, according to a group of employees.\nThe group, WeWorkers Coalition, formed in recent weeks and sent a letter to\nmanagement earlier this month stating that they “don’t want to be defined by\nthe scandals, the corruption and the greed exhibited by the company’s\nleadership.”\n\nThe group announced over the weekend that WeWork had reached an agreement with\nJLL to accept close to 1,000 maintenance and cleaning workers, many of whom\nwould then be contracted to work in WeWork buildings.\n\nHowever, the group raised alarm at the terms of the deal, and said that\nemployees were told by WeWork to sign the terms of the contract by Monday,\notherwise it would consider their resignations voluntary. The group said on\nTwitter that the contract has confused employees with pay discrepancies, and\ndemanded a deadline extension.\n\nIn a separate tweet, the group added that WeWork “is not following through on\nits promise to treat employees with ‘dignity and respect’ during this\nrestructuring process.”\n\nMany employees and shareholders with stock options are also waiting to hear\nwhen a $3 billion tender offer by SoftBank will be launched, after being\ndelayed for almost two weeks.\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by\nremembering your preferences and repeat visits.\n\nnewsletters give you the latest scoops, fresh headlines, marketing data, and\nthings to know within the industry.\n\nRound-up of top news and topics for each of the following cities:\n\n",

A\n43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling\nextreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet\nlung,\" according to a new case report.\n\nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained\nmalaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a\nlower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit\nafter that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days\noff work.\n\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness,\nsuch as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to\nbed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and\nthen needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was\nsigned off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\n\n**Related:** **7 Strange Signs You're Having an Allergic Reaction**\n\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be\nnormal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal\nInfirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed\nCT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\n\nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic\nreaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather\nbedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a\ncompound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was\ndiagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung\ninflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\n\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the\nbody's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air\nsacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we\nrealize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of\nhypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust\nfrom hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is\nsawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\n\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic\nsynthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six\nmonths he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and\nhe is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\n\n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\"\nthe patient wrote in the case study.\n\nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\"\nof the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the\nenvironment that trigger lung disease.\"\n\nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is\n\"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated\nunnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\n\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't\npanic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as\ncough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know,\nhe added.\n\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\n\n\nYasemin is a staff writer at Live Science, covering health, neuroscience and\nbiology.

        "articleBody": "\n\n### by Jeff FoustMonday, November 18, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of\nits long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud\nAssembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four\nRS-25 engines into the rocket’s core stage. With those engines in place, the\ncore stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center\nfor testing, including a “Green Run” test around the middle of next year where\nthose four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS\nlaunch.\n\n“If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and\nground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier\ndate,” Cooke said.\n\nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA’s exploration plans since the language in\nthe 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While\nthe plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will\nnonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite\ncost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least\nlate 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it\nwould be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly\nnot limited to) SpaceX.\n\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some\nmembers of Congress have suggested that NASA isn’t using SLS enough: that is,\nNASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current\nexploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with\nthe more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer\nlaunches.\n\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration’s\nown party in Congress. “Every space exploration study conducted over the last\n40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon\nand Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,” said Rep. Brian\nBabin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee’s space\nsubcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA’s exploration plans.\n\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS)\nprocurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers\nthat NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be\nlaunched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final\nversion did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided\nthey worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo\nversion of the SLS.)\n\n“While I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses\nmidstream is not a wise move at this point,” he continued.\n\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA’s approach that, in their view,\nminimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA’s\ncurrent architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched\ncommercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The\nlunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did\npropose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the\nascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander\nfrom the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\n\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. “The fewer launches and critical\noperations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,” said\nDoug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an\nindustry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House\nsubcommittee. (Cooke’s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS\ncore stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views\nlong before working with Boeing.)\n\n“If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” Stafford said\nof returning to the Moon.\n\n“SLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry\nOrion,” he continued. “If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS\nwith the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance\nof making an earlier date.” He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two\nSLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the\ntwo rendezvousing in lunar orbit—no Gateway required.\n\nAt last week’s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom\nStafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment.\nRep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them\nabout the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission\nsafety.\n\n“The mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,” Stafford, a\nmember of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke’s earlier\ntestimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success\nwith the current multiple-launch approach. “I cannot disagree with it.”\n\n“But with eight launches, I’ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of\nsuccess goes down to about 50 percent,” he concluded.\n\n“Oh my,” Lucas responded with a sigh.\n\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-\nlift launch vehicle. “If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to\nmake it,” he said. “You have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big,\nwide-diameter booster. If you don’t have it, you’re not going to make it.”\n\nYoung, in his testimony, didn’t specifically address the use of SLS versus\ncommercial rockets, but did criticize what he called “experiments” in\nprocurement. “Managing and contracting experiments must be excluded from the\nMars-Moon program,” he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment,\nhe brought up the HLS program.\n\n“A management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to\nthe surface of the Moon,” he said. “I personally think that these should be\ngovernment-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.”\n\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human\nspaceflight. “The plate is really full today,” he said. “I personally think\nthat the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number\ntwo is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done\nthat will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.”\n\nOne thing Young would push off NASA’s plate is the Gateway. “I do not really\nsee a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,” he said, although\nit could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. “There’s not a\ncompelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.”\n\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. “Adding an\nadditional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.”\n\nLast week’s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of\nCongress questioned NASA’s use—or unwillingness to use—the SLS. At a hearing\nlast month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep.\nRobert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater\nuse of SLS.\n\n“I understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for\nSLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,” he said,\nincluding the first Block 1B. “What do you think?”\n\n“It depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,” responded\nNASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn’t funding to\nsupport that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n\n“We haven’t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we’re guaranteed\nthe second core we’d need for a Moon landing in 2024,” added Ken Bowersox, the\nacting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA\nand the other witness at the hearing.\n\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced\nby 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first\ncrewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024\nthat would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface\nof the Moon. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident\nthat could happen.”\n\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. “What commercial launch\nvehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to\nlaunch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the\nMoon by 2024?”\n\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But\nfor the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy\nand Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from\nBlue Origin, and Northrop Grumman’s OmegA.\n\n“There could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,” Bridenstine added. “We’re\nnot shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some\ninvestment from Boeing to achieve.”\n\n“What is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not\navailable by 2024,” Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy\nis, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles—or SLS.\n\n“But if commercial’s not available, what’s the contingency plan?” Aderholt\nasked again.\n\n“I think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing\nin 2024 very, very difficult,” Bridenstine said. “If we don’t have the\nadditional rockets, then we’re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu\nwe’re confident we’ll have those rockets.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it\nwould provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal\narchitecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” Babin said of\npotential spending shortfalls for Artemis.\n\nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets,\nciting Cooke’s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged\nthat more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall\narchitecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more\nlaunches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n\n“We’re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing\nSystem how their systems ought to be developed,” Bridenstine said. “We’re\nwaiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we’ll assess\ntheir approaches.”\n\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that\nits approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day\nthe proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would\ninvolve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n\n“Using the lift capability of NASA’s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have\ndeveloped a ‘Fewest Steps to the Moon’ approach that minimizes mission\ncomplexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar\nsurface,” Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing\nDefense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\n\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the “national team” led\nby Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman.\nThe companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin’s New Glenn vehicles\nwould be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely\nbelieved to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the\ncompany has declined to publicly confirm that.)\n\nNASA’s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House\nnor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion\nbudget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis\non track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. José Serrano (D-NY),\nchairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without\nmore information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has\nyet to disclose.\n\n“It’s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal\nyear when we don’t know the costs down the road,” Serrano said. He suggested\npushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to\nthis March, “in order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission\nfor the benefit of the American people and the world.”\n\nBabin referred to those comments at last week’s hearing, concluding that the\nodds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were ”dwindling.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it\nwould provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal\narchitecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” he said.\n“This could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments\nalready made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.”\n\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA’s architecture for\nreturning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also\ninclude revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\n\nJeff Foust (jeff@thespacereview.com) is the editor and publisher of The Space\nReview, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews.

        "articleBody": "meganr@spokesman.com(509) 459-5382\n\nSouth Dakota’s viral “Meth. We’re on it.” awareness campaign has been facing\nbacklash and mockery since introduced on Monday, but Michelle Hege’s response\nwas concern.\n\nHege is the CEO of DH, the Spokane advertising, public relations and branding\nfirm behind the Washington Healthcare Authority’s Opioid Prevention campaign\n“Starts with one.”\n\n“I guess my first reaction was, ‘Oh no, they’re going to get a lot of\nattention and, maybe, not all of it helpful attention,’ ” Hege said. “At the\nend of the day, the proof’s in the pudding. I’m sure they’ve got a good\nevaluation plan in place to look at results over time, but I did feel\nconcerned that it may just create noise that doesn’t actually drive the\nbehaviors that they’re looking to drive.”\n\nWhen developing the “Starts with one” campaign – which will be in its third\nyear in January – DH did extensive research into the targeted audiences,\nworking with them directly to understand their knowledge, beliefs and values\nregarding opioid misuse. Selling a product is difficult, but altering behavior\nis much more difficult, Hege said.\n\n“It’s difficult to change people’s behaviors, but this is also some of the\nmost important advertising and communications work that’s out there,” Hege\nsaid. “This is our favorite kind of work to do because it’s a way to make a\npositive impact in the world.”\n\nWhile the “Meth. We’re on it.” campaign did not appeal to Julie Graham,\nWashington State Department of Health public information officer, she said she\ndid not want to judge the campaign, and thinks it could still be successful\nfor its audience.\n\n“When a group is trying to reach a very specific audience, the messaging can\neither be offensive or really miss the mark with the audience that’s not\nintended to see it,” Graham said.\n\nGraham said she once encountered backlash for an HIV prevention campaign that\nencouraged those recently released from jail to use condoms and receive\nscreenings.\n\n“You might need to have a message that’s very unique to the population that\nmight be at risk, and then you would want to put it in a place where you felt\nlike it would have the best chance of reaching that audience, so you might\nhave a little edgier message,” Graham said. “If somebody from the general\npublic saw it, they might think, ‘Wow this is a little over the edge’ or they\nmight think, ‘Why are they putting it here?’ It’s because it’s meant for a\nspecific population.”\n\nTargeting audiences is key in making dollars go further, Graham said, offering\nthe example of a recent domestic violence prevention campaign.\n\n“We were trying to reach young males, and we were doing our advertising on\ngaming sites, because we did some research that showed that that’s where a lot\nof young men were spending more time,” Graham said. “It can seem like there’s\na thousand choices for where to put your money and where your audience might\nbe looking now, but there is a benefit in having choices that are very\naudience-centric.”\n\nJeff Sanborn, president of Chapter & Verse, a Spokane and Seattle advertising\nand design agency, said he thought South Dakota’s campaign – run by a\nMinneapolis-based firm with a budget of $449,000 – was meant to raise\neyebrows.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, he posted materials from the campaign on the wall by the\ndining table of the company’s kitchen, where he posts new marketing findings\nand other things for members of his firm to ponder.\n\n“OK, great, let’s be provocative, let’s get people to notice it and talk about\nit, but I don’t think people are talking about it in the way that you want\nthem talking about it, right?” Sanborn said. “What’s America talking about?\nSouth Dakota’s got a meth problem, so that’s not the best thing for the South\nDakota brand.”\n\nSanborn said the campaign made the mistake of burying the message. That\nmessage is that anyone using meth is a problem for everyone and “we want to\ntry to help,” Sanborn said.\n\n“The problem is, we tell clients all the time, they’ll put the heart of their\nmessage somewhere deep in their third paragraph,” Sanborn said. “If that’s the\ncore and heart of your message, you better make that the five words that\neverybody in America reads.”\n\nLocal journalism is essential.\n\nGive directly to The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages community forums\nseries -- which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor\npositions at the newspaper -- by using the easy options below.

        "articleBody": "NASA has recruited SpaceX's Starship, Blue Origin's Blue Moon and three other\ncommercial lunar lander ideas to join its Artemis moon program.\n\nToday (Nov. 18), NASA announced the selection of SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra\nNevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc. to join\nits Commercial Lunar Payload Services program (CLPS). The five companies can\nnow vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to\npave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\n\n\"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\"\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Expanding the group\nof companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon's surface\ndrives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers. We\nanticipate opportunities to deliver a wide range of science and technology\npayloads to help make our vision for lunar exploration a reality and advance\nour goal of sending humans to explore Mars.\"\n\n**Related:** **SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy Mars Rocket in Pictures**\n\nThe five companies join nine others selected by CLPS in November 2018,\nbringing the total number of private moon lander hopefuls to 14 firms.\n\nThe newly selected five are:\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Blue Origin, Kent, Washington\n\n* Ceres Robotics, Palo Alto, California\n\n* Sierra Nevada Corporation, Louisville, Colorado\n\n* SpaceX, Hawthorne, California\n\n* Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc., Irvine, California\n\nThey include moon lander concepts of all sizes. They range from the truly\nmassive — SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle — to land multiple rovers on the\nmoon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak\nNano-Satellite Systems.\n\n\"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of\nprivate industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's\nassociate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the\nstatement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, we’ll expand our\nability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and\nsupport human exploration objectives.\"\n\nBlue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle, which\nthe company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.\n\nSierra Nevada Corp. and Ceres Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that\ncould potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.\n\nNASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to\ndeliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration\nRover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power\nstations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.\n\nNASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through\nNovember 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the\nprogram can bid on NASA delivery services.\n\n\"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\"\nClarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to\nreally broaden the pool — to bring on additional capabilities with new,\ninnovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"\n\nIn July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding\nlander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond.\nOrbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on\nfuture opportunities.\n\n\"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new\ntechnology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do\nmuch more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our\ncommercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate\nadministrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the\nstatement.\n\nArtemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by\n2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around\nthe moon by 2028.\n\nSuch activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on\nMars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have\nstressed.\n\nNASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers.\nThis past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build\nprototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the\nArtemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early\nnext year.\n\nMoon Rush: Private Lunar Lander Plans\n\nHere's Where Commercial Landers Will Land on the Moon for NASA\n\nNASA: The International Space Station Is Open for Business in Orbit\n\n**Correction:** An earlier version of this story stated that the newly\nselected companies would build private moon landers for NASA. Their selection\nmakes them eligible to compete for commercial moon lander contracts. Also,\nwhile Orbit Beyond stood down from its lander contract earlier this year, the\ncompany remains part of the CLPS program and is eligible to compete on future\nopportunities.\n\n_Email Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him_ _@tariqjmalik_ _Follow\nus on Twitter_ _@Spacedotcom_ _and on_ _Facebook_ _._\n\n\n\n_Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky\nand more!

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\nBusiness focus is why some people are able to build the online business they\ndream of while others _think_ about it … but never actually _create_ it?\n\nAnd why is it that some people are able to build an online presence … but\nnever get it to the level where they can live off the revenue it creates?\n\n**Related: How to Build Your Business Online, The Ultimate Guide**\n\nWhy does it seem like certain people come out of nowhere and claim their place\nin _your_ area of expertise before you’ve had a chance to claim it yourself?\n\nSo frustrating …\n\n## Welcome to my business focus strategy lesson\n\nToday, we’re going to talk about why _focus_ is important for success. Why\nit’s crucial, actually!\n\nI’ll share a free tool that will help you put your business in focus and\npinpoint what to work on right now — in less than five minutes.\n\n\n\nIf we haven’t met yet, my name is Pamela Wilson — and I have been working\nonline since 2010.\n\nI’m a three-time author, a keynote speaker, and an online educator, coach, and\nmastermind group leader.\n\nIn this article I’m sharing my approach to online business growth.\n\nIt was born from helping thousands of people create the online presence\nthey’ve dreamt of — and seeing way too many of them lose focus and struggle to\nget any results at all.\n\nOnce you understand my simple approach, you’ll feel much better about where\nyou are in the online business growth process — and that’s a promise.\n\n## How can I promise you’re about to feel better?\n\nBecause once you understand my approach …\n\n* You’ll recognize you don’t have to master everything about online business all at once\n\n* Your to-do list will shrink to 25% of its current size\n\n* You’ll be able to safely ignore 75% of the online information you’re seeing right now\n\nGet ready to start _enjoying_ the process of building your online business —\nmaybe for the first time ever!\n\nIf you are …\n\n* Trying to build an online business because you have deep expertise on a specific topic — but you’re “on hold” because you’re feeling overwhelmed\n\n* Wanting to leave a legacy of information and guidance around a topic you’re passionate about — but you don’t know where to start\n\n* Passionate about the business idea you’ve imagined — but unsure about how to make it happen\n\n… stick around. What you’re about to read is critical information that could\nchange the course of your life.\n\nReally.\n\n\n\n## How to put your business in focus the easy way\n\nThe goal of this series of articles is to help you steadily build the online\nbusiness you have in mind right now — without ever feeling lost and\noverwhelmed.\n\nYou’ll understand what matters now — and what you can ignore.\n\nThis is the key to making steady progress as you build your online presence!\n\n\n\n## A genius approach to online business building?\n\nNot to get too Albert Einstein on you, but …\n\nEvery online business exists in the 'space-time continuum.'\n\nThink about it:\n\n* You build your website in its own little corner of the internet\n\n* Search engines find it at the moment in time that it goes live\n\n* People begin to discover and use it\n\nYour relationship with the people you attract\n\n* grows person-by-person and day-by-day\n\nThe faster you can create an online business that exists in both space and\ntime, the faster these benefits will accrue:\n\n* Search engines will drive people to your information\n\n* You’ll go from imagining the people you want to serve to serving real people\n\n* Your\n\nemail list will begin to grow\n\n* Your products and services will all benefit from the interaction\n\n* Your revenues and impact will grow year-by-year\n\nAre you ready to make this happen?\n\n## How to avoid falling for every online pitch you see\n\nBefore we start, I’ve got to warn you about something that’s critically\nimportant. Not paying attention to this will virtually guarantee that you will\nstay stuck where you are.\n\nAnd you’ll have _a lot less money in your bank account._\n\nHere’s the thing …\n\nWhen you step into the online space, you’ll meet a whole new cast of\ncharacters. And they will try to sell you some pretty compelling stories.\n\nI'm here to tell you that the Laws of Physics apply to online business just\nlike offline business.\n\nIt takes time to build a successful business — offline **and** online.\n\n(I know, radical statement, right?)\n\nI want you to embrace this reality — because I’m about to show you how to get\ntime on your side.\n\nTrying to build an online business isn’t as simple as lots of people would\nhave you believe. It has its challenges.\n\nThere’s a lot of technology to master. There’s marketing involved — a _lot_ of\nmarketing. Maybe more marketing than you’re comfortable with.\n\nAnd there are all these moving parts — disparate bits of software that needs\nto interact to present your business and your offers seamlessly.\n\nYou’re about to save some major frustration, my friend. Money, too! Because it\nturns out your don’t need to **Buy All The Things** and **Learn All The\nThings** in order to make it online.\n\nI developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and\nerror — mine, and the people I taught.\n\n**It’s called Plan & Grow BIG.**\n\n\n\n## Focus on what really matters in the near future of your business\n\n**Plan & Grow BIG** helps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might\nbe stopping you from making real progress in your online business.\n\nMaybe you’re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you’ve been trying\nfor years to build a business idea you’ve had in your head — but it just isn’t\nliving up to what you expected.\n\nI developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting\nsidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they “needed” to\nmaster.\n\nFor example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads —\nbefore they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were\ngoing to offer.\n\nAnd I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was\nproven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an\nunproven product.)\n\nI saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. 🙁\n\nSmart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But\nthey were completely baffled by this “online business thing.”\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the\nfrustrations myself.\n\n\n\n## True confession: I had to learn business focus the hard way\n\nBefore I outline the **Plan & Grow BIG** approach and the specifics for each\nstage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out.\n\nI’m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this.\n\nBack in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business,\nZurek Design.\n\nI had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled\nprojects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also\njuggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their\n“launch” phases — they were in high school and starting to look at\nuniversities and think about their careers.\n\nI didn’t have a lot of time to spare.\n\nPlus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become\nmuch more of a “public figure” than I had ever had to be in my business in the\npast. I’d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And\nI’d need to “put myself out there” on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars,\nand in online video.\n\n_Yikes._\n\nAnd although my _offline_ business was making a solid income, my _online_\nbusiness idea — to share my marketing and design training with others — wasn’t\nmaking a single cent.\n\nI do, apparently!\n\nIt turns out that I was more courageous than I knew.\n\nBecause I did — I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course\ncalled Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time — an enormous amount\nof money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point.\n\nBut I’m glad I did.\n\nI truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that\ninvestment, I was telling myself, _“This dream matters. This dream is going to\nbecome a reality. I’m taking this seriously.”_\n\nOnce I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new,\nthings started happening for me.\n\nWithin a few months, I (the person who didn’t want to be seen online) had an\narticle accepted by the company behind the course I took — on one of the most-\npopular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger.\n\nThen another article went live. And another.\n\nNot just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the\nday.\n\nAnd through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then\ncoaching.\n\n\n\n## Out with the old, in with the new (and better)\n\nWithin a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline\nbusiness made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to\nfocus exclusively on my online efforts.\n\nThat’s what happens when you put your business in focus — and you spend time\ndoing what really matters.\n\nNow, I’m considered an authority on building an online presence.\n\nThat company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach\ntheir audience for a couple of years.\n\nHere’s what’s different in my life now:\n\n* My business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas)\n\n* I am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from me\n\n* My books are well-received and much loved — and deliver income to me every single month\n\n* People find my website and join my community every day, all year long\n\n* I’m able to travel anywhere I’d like because my business fits in my backpack\n\n* I can “dial up” or “dial back” my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my schedule\n\nHere’s the other important thing …\n\nI also have complete control over the direction I take my business. I answer\nto no one but myself! And I can adapt my offerings to what my audience needs\nwhenever I’d like.\n\nBut this story isn’t about me.\n\nWhat I’m about to share is the exact plan I’ve developed after seeing what\ntruly works online.\n\nIt’s the approach that has allowed me to build the business I have today. A\nbusiness where I’m in control — of my time, my projects, my earnings.\n\nAnd that’s what I want for you.\n\n## Ready to make online business building easier?\n\nYou wouldn’t have read this far if you didn’t also want to build this kind of\nonline business!\n\nThat’s why I want to make it easier for you.\n\n**What is your business focus right now?**\n\nIf you can’t answer that question immediately, read on.\n\n## How to use Plan & Grow BIG to put your business in focus and get your\nmindset straight\n\nThe purpose of the **Plan & Grow BIG** approach is to help you develop\nbusiness focus — and eliminate the feeling of overwhelm that keeps you from\nmaking progress.\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nI believe the #1 enemy of online progress is the flood of information about\nonline business tactics that bombards us every day.\n\nI want to show you how you can ignore most of the information you see!\n\nAnd how developing **business focus** will allow you to build the business\nyou’re dreaming about much faster — and with less frustration.\n\nTo get started, I created a simple quiz that will help you get more value from\nthis article.\n\nClick the button above so you can:\n\n* Discover what\n\n**business-building stage**\n\n* you’re in now\n\n* Assess what you’re starting with — make a\n\n**list of your current assets**\n\n* Pinpoint what your\n\n**current business focus**\n\n* should be\n\n* Get to know\n\n**what happens in the other business stages**\n\n* — so you can\n\n_put your business in_ _focus_\n\nAs we go through each stage of the **Plan & Grow BIG** approach, I want you to\nidentify areas of opportunity for your current situation.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\n## The four simple stages of Plan & Grow BIG\n\n\n\n### The Plan Stage: Think and dream productively\n\nIt’s the early days of your business.\n\nThink BIG. And work only on what’s needed in this stage.\n\nIn the PLAN stage, make these your business focus:\n\n**Pinpoint your ideal customer:**\n\n* Who will your online business serve? Warning: many people try to skip this step — don’t! You need to become acquainted with the people you want to reach and help before you build your branding and offers.\n\n**Get your branding in place:**\n\n* The earlier the better when it comes to\n\n* building your brand. You’ll want to decide your business name and\n\n* tagline, select your brand colors, and choose your brand fonts.\n\n**Map out your first offer:**\n\n* Decide how what solutions you’ll deliver and how you’ll deliver them. Will they be products, services, or both?\n\nThat’s it. Once you’ve completed the items above, it’s time to start building\nyour business, my friend. Ready?\n\n\n\n### The Build Stage: Create a tangible online asset\n\nTime to make ideas _real._ As you build these tangible business assets,\nremember: you don’t have to do it all at once.\n\nFocus on these business goals during the BUILD stage:\n\n**Build your initial website:**\n\n* You’ll need a Homepage, an About page, a Contact page, and some kind of “commerce” page, like a Store or Services page. Attract prospects by publishing regular content like blog articles, podcast episodes, or a video series.\n\n**Build your first offer:**\n\n* Don’t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that’s relatively simple — but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that.\n\n**Build an initial funnel:**\n\n* Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers.\n\nAnd now … stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it’s tempting to\nlook around at Version 9.0 of your competitors’ sites and feel like you have\nto catch up to them.\n\nNonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and\nbe proud you’re ready to move on …\n\n\n\n### The Implement Stage: Iterate to find what works\n\nOooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can\nfeel deeply uncomfortable.\n\nBut growth usually _does_ feel uncomfortable, doesn’t it?\n\nThe IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that’s perfectly fine. Here’s\nwhat you’ll focus on while you’re there:\n\n**Make your offers live:**\n\n* Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great — but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs.\n\n**Focus on building your email list.**\n\n* Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list — think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a\n\n_referral network._\n\n**Discover what works for launching your products and services.**\n\n* Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience.\n\nRemember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to\ndevelop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business.\nPatience, my friend!\n\nBut once you’ve hit on a winning product or service, you’ll be ready for …\n\n\n\n### The Grow Stage: Leverage your success\n\nIn the GROW stage, you’ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably\nin your business — and now you’ll focus on leveraging that success.\n\n**Improve your conversion rates:**\n\n* Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what’s working. You’ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible.\n\n**Add more revenue streams:**\n\n* As you dial into what’s working well, you may uncover your customers’ unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You’ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream.\n\nThe GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are\nreliable and you’re able to make some serious investments in your business.\n\n## Ready? Set? Get your business in focus!\n\nNow that you know your business stage (you DID take the quiz, right?), you can\ntap into the power of focused attention and make fast progress. **Ignore all\nthe techniques you’ll need in future stages, and just aim to master the stage\nyou’re in.**\n\nGet the Online Business Success Roadmap for an overview and a handy checklist\nof all the Plan & Grow BIG stages.\n\nWhen you do this, you can count on steady business growth — with less\nfrustration and more confidence because you’re focused on the right thing at\nthe right time.\n\n\n\n## The next BIG challenge is …\n\nNow that you’re clear about how to use a focused approach to eliminate\nfrustration and make faster progress, here’s the next big online business\nchallenge …\n\n**Becoming a “visible” and public leader in your space.**\n\nThis was a HUGE stumbling block for me.\n\nIn the next article, I’m going to share my mindset tips and tricks to help you\nbecome more comfortable with becoming a visible online leader. Once you\nembrace the increased visibility that comes with building an online business,\nyou’ll see all sorts of interesting doors open up.\n\n## Your go-forward plan for business focus\n\nThe BIG question is, how do you successfully shape an online business dream\ninto a viable online business that gives you the income, freedom, and\nrecognition you deserve?\n\nIt comes down to business focus. Which is easy once you know _what_ to focus\non, and what to ignore.\n\nOnce you’ve built that business, you have to stand out in front of it and\nrepresent it in your marketing, on social media, and at in-person events.\n\nIf you don’t master this, you’ll severely limit your reach and your impact. So\nhow do you get comfortable with this increased visibility?\n\nHow can you step up and embrace the “internet limelight?” Because once you do,\nonline doors will open for you!\n\nRead about that topic in the next article in this series, How to Adopt an\nOnline Leader Success Mindset.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks so much for stopping by to read this long article, Gaye, and for\nleaving a comment, too! You’re pretty awesome yourself — I’m glad our paths\nhave crossed. 🙂\n\nJan Smith\n\nAugust 8, 2018 at 7:21 pm\n\nHi, Pamela, I am a guy in his mid-70’s who has had 2 financial disasters. I\nspent all savings (including all retirement $) just to survive. That said, I’m\nhaving the time of my life right now by helping others to conquer fear, worry,\ndoubt panic, etc. by applying wisdom from the Bible that God has patiently\npoured into me. The comments I receive from readers is so astonishing to me! I\nnever started out to do anything like that.\n\nBlog articles are free for anyone to read, but I do have two online courses\nthat bundle together articles from the blog with some new content. The income\npays for secure web hosting, and list-building technology.\n\nWhat I’m wondering is: given that my focus is more on being helpful than on\ngetting the money, I don’t see that as being consistent with the focus of\nevery purveyor of online “how to sell, sell, sell” focus.\n\nSo, how would your plan help someone like me, given that I have no extra money\nand will not go into debt to buy whatever you are selling?\n\nPamela Wilson\n\nAugust 8, 2018 at 7:34 pm\n\nI’m really glad to hear you’ve found a way to serve that feels really good to\nyou, Jan.\n\nI offer free information every single month here on the blog. I host free in-\ndepth workshops every month, too.\n\nIf you feel like buying something, you can get my 99 cent Kindle book! And if\nyou really want to splurge, you can get _Master Content Marketing_ for well\nunder $20.\n\nThere’s absolutely no need take on debt to learn around here — I hope you find\nit helpful.\n\nAnita DeSousa\n\nAugust 10, 2018 at 9:40 am\n\nEnjoyed your article, focus is extremely important to be successful with\nanything!\n\nI have many ideas floating around just not sure how to make a go of it with an\nonline business or if that is even the right thing for me. ?\n\nWill continue to read articles and learn, so it will not be so overwhelming\nwhen I can “focus” and do it right.\n\nUntil then just juggling ?‍♀️\n\nPamela Wilson\n\nAugust 10, 2018 at 9:51 am\n\nAnita, it’s so good to see you here! That “ideas floating around” challenge is\nsomething every entrepreneur I know has to deal with. I hope you find some\nclarity on these pages. 🙂\n\nYvonne DiVita\n\nAugust 11, 2018 at 9:51 am\n\nI relate to the ” you can spend a lot of money on a lot of things and get\nnowhere” idea. So many people are out there pitching us. I get so many\ninvitations to build a better business, using this advice or that. And, it’s\nalways the same.\n\nExcept here. You are unique. Your approach is so focused, it’s almost funny…\nbecause, why can’t we figure all that out? I know the answer… the answer is –\nbecause we are bombarded with content that purports to have the answer and we\nspend too much time trying to do things the way someone else wants us to.

        "articleBody": "Kevin Johnson\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Two federal prison officers were charged Tuesday with falsifying\nrecords, stating they had checked on accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in\nthe hours before he hanged himself in his Manhattan cell.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, assigned to\nEpstein's special housing unit at Metropolitan Correctional Center, \"browsed\nthe Internet,\" lingered in an office common area and appeared to sleep for two\nhours when they should have been conducting inmate checks.\n\nNoel and Thomas signed \"false certifications\" attesting they had made their\nrequired rounds, according to court records.\n\nProsecutors alleged that no inmate checks were made from 10:30 p.m. Aug. 9 to\n6:30 a.m. the following morning, when the officers discovered Epstein's body.\nDuring that time, the officers should have conducted five separate inmate\ncounts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly\nshowed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night,\naccording to court documents.\n\n“As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of\nfederal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,”\nGeoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said\nin a news release. “Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks\non inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.”\n\nEach defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records.\nNoel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is\ncharged with three.\n\nThe conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the\ncharges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nNoel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday\nafternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond\nwithin a week.\n\nEpstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many\nvictims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nHis suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons.\nAttorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered\nmultiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations\nat the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\n\n## Indictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress\n\nAs the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the\nSenate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage\nover the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the\nprison system.\n\n\"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer,\nrepeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track\nof such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify\nagainst his other co-conspirators.\"\n\nProsecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of\nminor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other\nlocations from at least 2002 to 2005.\n\nSasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\n\"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of\nPrisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some\nanswers. These arrests are important, but they’re not the end of this.\n\n\"These guards aren’t the only ones who should stand trial – every one of\nJeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives\nbehind bars,” Sasse said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEpstein accusers pour out their anger in court\n\nOne by one, more than a dozen of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers stood before a\njudge and poured out their anger toward the financier Tuesday, taking\nadvantage of an extraordinary opportunity to be heard in court after Epstein's\njailhouse suicide. (Aug. 27)\n\nHawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation\nand a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she\nacknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other\ninstances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and\nfalsified records to show that they had.\n\n\"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This\nincident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad\nstaff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when\nsomething bad happens.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems\nwithin the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of\nthe system.\"\n\nAlthough representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier\nmay have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports\nanything other than suicide.\n\n**Internal memo:** Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks,\ninmate counts\n\n## Investigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\n\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself\nwith a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he\nhad been murdered.\n\nFor months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned\nto Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\n\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers\nassigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at\nleast eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10,\nprosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that\nthey had not made their required checks.\n\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do\nany rounds.\"\n\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court\nhearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos.\nThey and the defendants left without responding to reporters’ questions.\n\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. “It is our\nhope that we’ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,” said\nJason Foy, who represents Noel.\n\nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a\nplea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of\nthree children, and a guilty plea would “ruin his life.”\n\n“We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would try to make an effort to\naddress the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,”\nFiggins said.\n\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that\nthey’re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they’re\ngoing to face going to jail and losing their whole career?”\n\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night\nEpstein died. “When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran\nand how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you’ll\nhave a different appreciation for what was going on.”\n\n## Prisons plagued by understaffing\n\nPrison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and\nfrequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised\nsecurity at the Manhattan facility.\n\n**Staffers 'don't care':** Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before\nJeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at\nthe facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union.\nPrison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to\nplug unfilled officer positions, she said.\n\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift,\nthe one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to\nfederal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the\n20 staffers were working overtime.\n\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention\ncenter, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave.\nOne of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime\nshifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\n\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling\nlawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the\nsystem.\n\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure\nof old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the\ncountry, including at the Manhattan detention center.\n\nAfter the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying,\n\"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public’s\ntrust in us.”\n\n**Epstein's inner circle eyed:** Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could\nstill go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\n\n## Epstein removed from suicide watch\n\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell,\nsemiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him\non suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring days later, which has\ndrawn investigative interest.\n\nExperts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from\nsuicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the\ninmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\n“When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be\ncritical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra\nmonitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert\nfrom San Diego.\n\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature\nof his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior\nsuicide attempt.\n\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to\nsee authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\n\n“Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there\nare no coincidences.”\n\n_Contributing: Kristine Phillips_\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "articleBody": "В восьмидесятых годах чешская красавица заявила о себе на весь мир. Тогда\nтрудно было найти журнал, на страницах которого не было бы фотографий Полины.\nЗатем девушка подалась в мир кино. Она снималась у многих режиссеров\n(например, у Кустурицы в «Аризонской мечте»), а ее партнерами по фильмам\nстановились Джонни Депп и Микки Рурк.\n\nСейчас Полине исполнилось 53 года, и хоть выглядит она до сих пор на все сто,\nее охватила настоящая паника.\n\nВ интервью модель призналась, что жутко боится старости. «Когда вся ваша жизнь\nсостояла в том, чтобы выглядеть хорошо, стареть публично – это ужасно. Это не\nдля слабонервных, – пожаловалась Поризкова. — Я постоянно борюсь с собой,\nвнутренне говоря: «Да ладно, красота не так уж важна! Отпусти ее и\nсосредоточься больше на том, что еще можно сделать!»\n\nНо пока у модели это не получается. Она откровенно рассказала, что, хоть пока\nи не колола ботокс, постоянно прибегает к тем или иным процедурам красоты,\nчтобы сохранить молодость как можно дольше, и тратит на это почти все\nсвободное время.\n\n«Я лично ненавижу, когда вижу, что кто-то сделал и пластику, и уколы для\nсохранения красоты, но они утверждают, что причина, по которой они так хорошо\nвыглядят, – это йога и вода. Сразу понятно, что они врут».\n\nБывшая супермодель призналась, что боится: люди высмеивают то, как она\nвыглядит сейчас. «Я думаю, что кто-то сейчас скажет: эй, посмотри на эту\nкрасивую женщину, которая превратилась в эту отвратительную старуху».\n\nНо нам кажется, Поризкова слегка лукавит. Старухой ее назвать ни у кого язык\nне повернется. Полина до сих пор позирует для глянцевых журналов и выглядит\nлучше многих молодых моделей. Между прочим, некоторые фотосеты весьма\nпровокационны. Например, она приняла участие в проекте для модного издания.\nВместо одежды на телах моделей были лишь надписи, отражавшие самые важные для\nних ценности. Поризкова выбрала слово «Правда».\n\nДа и муж Полины до сих пор просто обожает ее. Поризкова и музыкант Рик Оказек\nпоженились еще на заре ее карьеры и уже почти 30 лет счастливы в браке. Да и\nкто бы не гордился такой красавицей-женой!\n\n",

In the end, we will\nwin and save our Country from certain destruction,” Trump tweeted soon after\nthe House Select Committee on Intelligence concluded its third public\nimpeachment hearings on Tuesday.\n\nIn the morning, Democratic lawmakers grilled Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a\nUkraine specialist on the National Security Council (NSC), and Jennifer\nWilliams, a top national security aide to Vice President Pence on Trump's July\n25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\nLater in the day, Kurt Volker, former special envoy to Kyiv, and Tim Morrison,\nanother top NSC aide, testified before the powerful House Committee.\n\nThe White House called the impeachment process a sham.\n\n\"Today's second hearing is over, and the Democrats’ central allegation in this\nimpeachment sham has again been completely debunked,\" White House Press\nSecretary Stephanie Grisham said at the conclusion of the testimonies.\n\n“Specifically, Ambassador Volker confirmed under oath that he had no\nindication whatsoever of anything that resembled a quid-pro-quo, corroborating\nhis previous deposition testimony that ‘there was no linkage like that,\" she\nsaid.\n\nGrisham urged the American public not to tolerate the pretense of the\nDemocrats.\n\n“With the Democrats’ poll-tested ‘quid-pro-quo’ and ‘bribery’ narratives in\nshambles, the American public should not be forced to endure this charade for\none more second,” Grisham said.\n\n“We have learned nothing new in today's illegitimate ‘impeachment’\nproceedings. However, buried among the witnesses’ personal opinions and\nconjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both\nwitnesses testified the July 25 transcript was ‘accurate’ and nothing\nPresident Trump has done or said amounts to ‘bribery’ or any other crime,” she\nadded.\n\nGrisham also accused the Democrats of being blinded by their hatred for\nPresident Trump.\n\n“Today's hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats\nare simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to\noverturn the outcome of a free and fair election,” Grisham said.\n\nHowever, both Vindman and Williams told lawmakers that Trump’s request to\nUkrainian president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate.\n\nVolker and Morrison said that the call with Zelensky was not in line with\nAmerican national security goals.\n\n“Frankly I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was probably an element of\nshock that may be in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy\ncould play out was playing out and how this was likely to have significant\nimplications for US national security,” Vindman said.\n\nWilliams said the phone call was unusual and inappropriate.\n\n“I believe what I found unusual or different about this call was the\npresident's reference to specific investigations. That struck me as different\nthan other calls I had listened to,” she said.\n\n“I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations such\nas former Vice President Biden and his son struck me as political in nature\ngiven that former Vice President is a political opponent of the president,”\nWilliams said.\n\n“I can't speak to what the president's motivation was in referencing it, but I\njust noted that the reference to Biden sounded political to me,” she said in\nresponse to a question.\n\nDuring the later hearing, Volker said that he does not think that raising 2016\nelections or Vice President Biden or these things that he considers to be\nconspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians, particularly\nthe former prosecutor general, are they're not things that one should be\npursuing as part of the national security strategy with Ukraine.\n\n“We should be supporting Ukraine's democracy, reforms, and its own fight\nagainst corruption domestically, its struggle against Russia, its defense\ncapabilities. These are the heart of what we should be doing, and I don't\nthink pursuing these things serves a national interest,” Volker said.\n\nDeccan Herald News now on Telegram - Click here to subscribe\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\nHow do you shop for a tech-savvy person who buys the latest of everything\nbefore the holidays arrive? I am totally that person for my family when it\ncomes to the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nThere are some Apple products that I can never have enough of like App Store\ngift cards and another HomePod, but stocking stuffers and expensive smart\nspeakers aren’t always the right gift.\n\nThat’s why I’m approaching my gift recommendations this year a bit different.\nLast year I covered an area of great interest and expertise with smart home\nproducts, and most of those picks are still applicable.\n\nBut there’s also a lot of new technology out this year as well as gadgets I’ve\nreceived for testing — new technology that I’m super glad to see exist. Read\non to see my favorite picks for new tech that I’m grateful for this year.\n\n### Satechi 72W USB-C Power Delivery Car Charger\n\nApple first started replacing its proprietary MagSafe 2 connector with USB-C\non MacBooks in 2015. In theory, this opened the door for charging Apple\nlaptops with portable batteries and car chargers similar to iPhones and iPads.\n\nThe only catch was power delivery speeds: even the lightweight 12-inch MacBook\nwould struggle to keep a charge during use on car chargers and battery packs.\nA better USB-C spec called PD for power delivery cranked up the peak wattage,\nand now it’s totally possible to push a MacBook Pro to the limit _while\ncharging in the car_.\n\n\n\nSatechi’s awesome $29 72W USB-C PD Car Charger is the first car charger I’ve\ntested with this capability, and mine is an absolute treasure to me. It\nfeatures two ports: a 60W USB-C PD port and a 12W USB-A port. This lets you\ncharge an iPhone or iPad simultaneously while charging a MacBook Pro — even\nduring use.\n\nIt’s amazing for getting work done as a passenger on a long road trip. I’m\nstill amazed at how I can arrive somewhere with 100% battery in my MacBook Pro\nwhen just a few years ago my 12-inch MacBook could barely keep its battery\npercentage while charging.\n\nAnker also has USB-C car chargers, including one with a 30W USB-C PD port and\nanother with dual 18W USB-C PD ports, but neither match the 60W output from\nSatechi.\n\n### RAVPower 61W USB-C PD GaN Wall Charger\n\nIt’s not just mobile USB-C chargers for Macs that have improved. MacBook Air\nand MacBook Pro wall chargers have also advanced this year — not in terms of\npower delivery but in miniaturization.\n\nThanks to new GaN (gallium nitride) charging bricks, you can find fast and\nreliable iPad Pro and MacBook Pro wall chargers that are more compact than\nwhat Apple includes in the box.\n\n\n\nRAVPower’s 61W USB-C Power Delivery GaN Wall Charger is my go-to solution for\niPad Pro and MacBook Pro. I’ve bought two so far and am just a few clicks away\nfrom owning a third.\n\nThe $49 charging brick regularly goes on sale for as low as $29, and the fact\nthat it’s black like my MacBook keyboard and not white like Apple’s chargers\npleases me to no end. It pairs perfectly with the black Monoprice Essentials\nUSB-C charging cable, available in 0.5 to 4 meter lengths from $6 to $12.\n\nThe all-black compact wall charger and extra long charging cable is one of my\ntop tech discoveries this year.\n\n### Mophie 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad\n\nThis is also the year that Apple cancelled its failed AirPower charging mat\nproject first announced in 2017. Lots of AirPower alternatives have tried to\nfill the wireless charging pad void for simultaneously charging an iPhone,\nApple Watch, and AirPods.\n\nWhile no one has matched Apple’s vision of lay-it-anywhere-on-the-mat wireless\ncharging (including Apple), there is one similar 3-in-1 charging solution that\nstands out.\n\n\n\nMophie’s recently introduced 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad has a dedicated spot\nfor charging any Apple Watch, AirPods Pro or AirPods with Wireless Charging\nCase, and iPhone 8 or later. It’s not cheap at $140, but it’s very nice to own\nand makes for a great gift.\n\nThis has been my bedside charger since the fabric-covered version debuted a\ncouple months ago. It looks a lot better than three individual chargers on my\nnightstand, and packing a single charger in my bag during travel is a dream.\n\n\n\nPrior to Mophie’s solution, I spent a few months testing Nomad’s version\n(pictured above) that launched first. Both offer a very similar experience,\nbut I prefer the tighter design of Mophie’s personally. If you don’t need the\nApple Watch charging piece, Mophie also sells a similar 2-in-1 wireless\ncharging mat with a USB-A port for charging a third device over the wire for\n$60 less.\n\nEven with Apple’s AirPower project canceled, wireless charging moved forward\nthis year. Twelve months ago there was no wireless charging case for AirPods,\nApple Watch had its own charger on my nightstand, and I had a single wireless\ncharger on my nightstand.\n\n### Samsung 4K Smart LED TV\n\nSpeaking of one year ago, I definitely didn’t expect to ever include a Samsung\nTV on my Apple gift guide. That changed at the turn of the year when Apple\nintroduced AirPlay 2 for smart TVs without an Apple TV box connected.\n\nSamsung was the first to release AirPlay 2 support for wirelessly sending\naudio or video from an Apple device to a smart TV back in March.\n\nRecent Samsung smart TVs also include the Apple TV app watching movies and TV\nshows purchased from iTunes, viewing the new Apple TV+ streaming service, and\neven watching other video services like HBO and CBS All-Access through Apple\nTV Channels.\n\n\n\nOn the day that Samsung announced their Apple features were shipping, I rushed\nover to Best Buy to find the lowest priced compatible Samsung TV just to try.\nThat turned out to be the UN43NU6900FXZA, a 43-inch 4K LED 2018 model TV for\n$278.\n\nFor context, the current Apple TV lineup ranges from $150 to $200 _before_ you\nfactor the cost of a new TV.\n\n\n\nI’ve been using the Samsung smart TV with no Apple TV as my bedroom TV since\nAirPlay 2 and the Apple TV app appeared in a software update. Highly\nrecommended as an affordable way to put both Apple features in a new room\nwithout spending a fortune.\n\n### Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router\n\nWi-Fi 6, formerly known as 802.11ax, has hit the market this year as the next\ngeneration of Wi-Fi after 802.11ac.\n\nPrior to September, I would have said Wi-Fi 6 was too new to consider this\nyear. Wireless routers that support Wi-Fi 6 are markedly more expensive than\n802.11ac wireless access points, and you need Wi-Fi 6 devices to best take\nadvantage of the new Wi-Fi standard (save for improvements in speed delivery\nbetween multiple mesh routers).\n\nThen the iPhone 11 lineup landed with 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 support included.\niPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max are the first Apple devices\nwith Wi-Fi 6 support built-in, and we’re sure to see more Apple hardware join\nnext year.\n\n\n\nIf you’re considering a Wi-Fi upgrade for your family or really trying to\ntreat the tech-savvy person in your life, a Wi-Fi 6 mesh router feels like a\nfuture pick this year that you can buy now.\n\nI’ve been testing the Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Router (regular $400,\ncurrently on sale for $300) for a few weeks with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, and\nearly results are promising. This is a gift that will continue to deliver as\nyour tech family or friend upgrades their gadgets across 2020.\n\nIf Wi-Fi 6 adoption feels too far out in the future, you can get more mesh\nbang for your buck (in black) with a Linksys Velop Wi-Fi 5 mesh router two-\npack.\n\n### Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse\n\nMy two-year-old son played a game of hide-and-seek with the black Magic Mouse\nthat came with my iMac Pro over the summer, except he forgot the whole seek\npart.\n\nI needed a new mouse for my desk but didn’t want to buy the same mouse again\nonly to have it eventually turn up somewhere. I tried the Logitech MX Master\n2S mouse instead. I liked the feel and control of the MX Master mouse so much\nthat I kept using it even after my toddler revealed that my Magic Mouse was\nsomehow tucked inside a crevice in my desk chair.\n\n\n\nThen the well-reviewed MX Master 2S was replaced with an even better reviewed\n$99 Logitech MX Master 3 advanced mouse. I received one for testing alongside\nthe $99 Logitech’s MX Keys keyboard, and I have to say the two are a great\npair.\n\nMy favorite feature of both is that the mouse and keyboard can connect and\ncharge over USB-C (Apple’s mouse and keyboard use Lightning) which is the same\ncharger as my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro.\n\n\n\nThe MX Master 3 mouse also has an even better feel in the hand than the MX\nMaster 2S, and more buttons for customizing actions with a click. The MX Keys\nwireless keyboard is backlit, unlike Apple’s standalone Magic Keyboard.\n\nThen there’s reliable fast switching between paired devices on both the mouse\nand keyboard. I have each paired to my iMac Pro _and_ my iPad Pro, and\nswitching between which device I’m using is as easy as a button press. Highly\nrecommended as a great way to improve existing hardware or take the iPad Pro\neven further.\n\n### Brydge Pro Keyboard for iPad Pro\n\nApple released the 11-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 12.9-inch iPad Pro before\nthe end of last year. Keyboard case maker Brydge had to go back to the drawing\nboard with its special keyboard for making iPads feel like MacBooks.\n\nBrydge proved it was up for the challenge when it launched a redesigned\nkeyboard case for the all-new iPad Pro designs earlier this year. While it’s\nnot the iPad keyboard solution for me (I prefer the on-screen keyboard or\nSmart Keyboard Folio), I did receive one for testing this year for someone in\nmy house.\n\nMy wife was going back to school to advance her nursing degree, and her\n12-inch MacBook from April 2015 was really starting to show its age — even\nafter a keyboard repair.\n\nNaturally, I took this opportunity to try the newest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for\nmyself and let her inherit my 11-inch iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard Folio.\niPadOS 13 made switching from the Mac to the iPad full time finally possible\nfor her, but she soon let me know how cramped the 11-inch Smart Keyboard felt\nto her.\n\n\n\nBrydge Pro for iPad Pro to the rescue. I suggested she try the Bluetooth,\nbacklit keyboard case, and she immediately took to the MacBook-like keyboard\ncase. I haven’t seen her use the iPad Pro without the Brydge Pro ($129,\nregular $149) since the day she got it.\n\nIt may not be _for me_ , but it’s absolutely a highly regarded keyboard case\namong former Mac and PC users leveraging the power of the iPad now.\n\n_Published November 18, 2019.

        "articleBody": "by Jeff Foust — November 18, 2019\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON — NASA announced Nov. 18 that it was adding five companies to a\ncontract to perform commercial deliveries of payloads to the surface of the\nmoon, a group that ranges from small ventures to Blue Origin and SpaceX.\n\nNASA said the five companies — Blue Origin, Ceres Robotics, Sierra Nevada\nCorporation (SNC), SpaceX and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems — had been selected\nto join the nine companies with Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)\ncontracts. All 14 companies are now eligible to bid on future task orders for\nthe delivery of payloads to the lunar surface.\n\nThis “on-ramp” to CLPS was specifically designed to attract companies with the\ncapability to carry heavier payloads to the surface of the moon. This includes\nNASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission, a\nrover NASA plans to fly in 2022 to look for evidence of water ice at the south\npole of the moon.\n\n“We were actually looking to do this a little bit later, but we saw the need\nto accelerate that,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for\nexploration in NASA’s science mission directorate, said of that on-ramp in a\nteleconference with reporters. The larger landers, he said, could deliver\ntools needed by astronauts ahead of their landing missions, in addition to\ndelivering science payloads.\n\nThe largest lander, by far, of the new entrants is from SpaceX, which bid its\nStarship reusable launch vehicle. Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief\noperating officer of SpaceX, said that Starhip will be able to deliver up to\n100 metric tons of cargo to the surface of the moon and return an unspecified\namount back to Earth.\n\n“We do think this is a really neat program. It reminds us a bit of the COTS\nprogram,” said Shotwell, referring to NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation\nServices effort that funded the development of SpaceX’s commercial cargo\ncapability.\n\nShotwell said Starship lunar lander missions could begin in 2022. Such\nmissions would be cargo only, but she said could serve as a “nice stepping\nstone” to later crewed missions. She didn’t give a date for crewed missions,\nbut said SpaceX would fly Starship “a lot” before flying any missions with\npeople on board.\n\n\n\nBlue Origin will offer NASA its Blue Moon lander that the company unveiled in\nMay, capable of carrying several tons of cargo to the lunar surface. “It has a\nlot of payload capacity, power to get through the lunar night, a very large,\nopen payload deck,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of advanced\ndevelopment programs at Blue Origin. He declined later to state when the\nlander would be ready for CLPS missions, saying it would depend on the\nspecifics of each individual CLPS task order.\n\nNASA also added smaller landers to the CLPS contract. “Our company is in a\ngreat position not only to bid on smaller payloads going to the Moon because\nwe build our own satellite systems,” said John Roth, vice president of\nbusiness development at SNC. Roth said the company could take larger payloads\nleveraging technologies developed for its Dream Chaser vehicle, but he did not\ndisclose how large of a payload the company could carry. SNC would be able to\nstart lunar lander missions in 2022, he said.\n\nMichael Sims, chief executive of Ceres Robotics, said his company’s CLPS award\nwas a sign small companies like his had a role in NASA’s broader plans. “Space\nexploration and, especially, humans becoming multiplanetary requires an entire\necosystem of companies,” he said. “Small player being an agility and a\ncreativity that adds to the mix.” He said his company’s lander should be\navailable for missions starting in 2023.\n\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems is best known for being a smallsat manufacturer.\nMarco Villa, the company’s chief operating officer, said Tyvak would leverage\nthat experience in its lunar landers. “We’re going to start with something\nsmaller,” he said. “Our flexibility and ability to scale up is going to lead\nus to fulfill more and more complex missions in the near future.” He declined\nto say when his company’s lander would be ready.\n\nThe five companies, selected from eight that submitted proposals to this on-\nramp, join the original nine CLPS companies selected by NASA nearly a year\nago: Astrobotic, Deep Space Systems, Draper, Firefly Aerospace, Intuitive\nMachines, Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems, Moon Express and OrbitBeyond.\nIn May, NASA awarded task orders to Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and\nOrbitBeyond for lunar lander missions, but OrbitBeyond canceled its task order\ntwo months later, citing internal business issues.\n\nClarke said NASA is developing a new task order companies that should be\nreleased “sometime soon” for the CLPS companies to bid on, as well as one for\nthe VIPER rover. The agency is separately working on a call for proposals for\nscience instruments to fly on those missions, with a goal of doing two\n“deliveries” of payloads to the lunar surface every year.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\nInstagram began testing hiding public like counts globally on Thursday, after\nexperimenting with the design tweak in several individual markets abroad.\nPeople who upload photos and videos will still know how many people liked\nthem—that information just won’t be seen by other users. The experiment is\npart of a wider shift at social media companies, so far mostly a rhetorical\none, away from the metrics it once told people had immense value. Like\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has spoken out about the\ntoxic consequences of overemphasizing statistics like follower and like\ncounts. Twitter also released a beta version of its app earlier this year that\nputs less prominence on likes and retweets.\n\nBut Instagram is one of the only major platforms to try bringing so-called\ndemetrication to a wider segment of users. It’s previously tested removing\nlikes in Italy, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and\nthe United States. Amid growing criticism of online platforms, abandoning\nlikes allowed Mosseri to claim that Instagram wants to be “a space that feels\nmuch less pressurized.” But the Facebook-owned company has also quietly\nencouraged some users to embrace the anxiety and power that enhanced metrics\ncan provide, by prompting them to convert their personal profiles into\nInstagram business accounts. Unsurprisingly, opening a business account is\nalso a gateway to buying ads.\n\nInstagram first introduced business accounts in 2016. There are now 140\nmillion monthly active “businesses” across Facebook’s various platforms,\naccording to the company. Any user can convert their personal profile into a\n“business” or “creator” one at any time, both of which come with souped-up\nanalytics capabilities. Many normal people, with no intention of making money\nfrom their Instagram presence, have opted-in to the feature. In the age of\ninfluencers, where the line between personal branding and personal life has\nall but disappeared, some people are naturally eager to run their Instagram\nprofile like it’s a job—and Instagram is happy to help.\n\nKym Lino, a spokesperson for Instagram, confirmed to WIRED that the company\nnotifies people who it thinks could benefit from converting their personal\naccounts into business ones. “We use a machine learning model which predicts\nlikely commercial intent of Instagram accounts to identify potential accounts\nthat may benefit from professional tools like analytics,” they said in an\nemail. It’s unclear what those signals might be, and Instagram declined to\nsay.\n\n#### Content\n\nI changed my personal Instagram profile, which I started in 2013, into a\nprofessional one several weeks ago. Instagram allows you to choose what type\nof business you run, and I earnestly chose “Journalist.” I later found that\nmany people, especially teens, opt for more ironic options like Cruise Line or\nWell Water Drilling Service. One friend has labeled herself a Grocery Store.\nAfter a few days, the statistics started rolling in. I could suddenly see\nthings like how many people unfollowed me each week, how many visited my\nprofile, and how many tapped on the people and places I tagged in my stories.\nIt was eye-opening.\n\nI learned that over a dozen people tapped on the profile of a coworker after I\ntagged us eating Mexican food in my story. And I found out 46 people, for some\nreason or another, visited my profile in the last week—but only 16 had come\nfrom the one picture I uploaded. On that photo, of one of my oldest friends, I\nhad written a long and gushing caption celebrating her birthday. My business\naccount informed me that someone sent it to another person via direct message,\nbut I couldn’t tell who or why. The analytics made salient the ways my friends\nand acquaintances surveil one another on Instagram all the time.\n\n“I was stunned just to see how many people visited my profile even without\nposting for several months,” said Joseph Minga, a friend who recently switched\nto a professional Instagram account. He learned around 75 to 100 people view\nhis profile a week, out of around 1,500 followers. “It really made me take a\nstep back and ask _what are they looking for on here?_ and in all seriousness,\n_could I have a cyberstalker?_ ”\n\nInstagram also lets you see how people interact with your stories, including\nhow many view them more than once, and the number who swipe away. “I was on\nvacation with my parents in France and posted it on my story. And like, of my\n1,000 followers, five swiped away,” said Will Tjernlund, a consultant for\nAmazon sellers who has a business Instagram account. “It’s like wholesome\ncontent, that’s normal, and a cool image and background, and someone following\nme was like nah, not for me dog.”\n\nEven though Instagram’s professional analytics are extremely granular, they’re\nstill anonymized, and can’t account for the reason _why_ someone took a\nspecific action. That makes it easy to agonize about what you don't know.\n“Since I have seen some of the extra data, I will question why I lost 14\nfollowers in a week where I did not post anything at all. I don’t post as\noften anymore,” said Minga. “I think I have some sort of social media stage\nfright. Seeing that people were forwarding my posts to others via DM made me\nfeel insecure.”\n\nIn addition to behavior metrics, Instagram provides business accounts with a\nwealth of demographic data about their followers. That includes where they\nlive, how old they are, whether they’re male of female (there’s no recognition\nof users who identify as nonbinary or transgender) and the times of day\nthey’re active on the platform. It’s easy to see how this information would be\nuseful to an influencer trying to boost engagement, or a brand who wants to\nknow more about their audience. Instagram also attaches a large “Promote”\nbutton to every post, giving people the option to turn them into ads.\n\nAs both NBC News and Bloomberg have reported, there’s a security risk\nassociated with business Instagram accounts, which is particularly hazardous\nfor minors. When people convert to business accounts, they often accidentally\nmake their email address or phone number public. The feature is meant to make\nit easy for people to contact legitimate business entities, but kids with\nbusiness accounts also end up revealing their personal information to the\nworld.\n\nWIRED spoke to one mother, who knew her teenage daughter and son were\nmasquerading as a Tax Preparation Service and a Go-Kart Track on Instagram,\nbut didn’t realize their personal information might be on their profiles. “I\nam so ahead of every other parent of teens I know when it comes to\ntechnology,” she said. “I am literally facepalming that my 14-year-old son has\na public Instagram account with his phone number on it.” Her daughter, on the\nother hand, had cleverly put down the number for Pizza Hut instead.\n\n“Businesses and creators are clearly informed in the sign-up or conversion\nflow that the contact information they would like to make public to help\npeople contact them will be displayed,” Lino said. Last month, Instagram also\nmade it possible for creator and business accounts to choose not to display\ntheir contact information.\n\nDavid Stier, a data scientist and business advisor in the Bay Area, has spent\nthe last few months trying to track the global number of minors who may have\nprofessional Instagram accounts. He stumbled upon the issue while researching\nInstagram marketing for a potential client and became concerned. Because users\ncan easily toggle between being corporations, “creators,” and normal people,\nStier says he noticed the lines between all three groups on Instagram have\nblurred. “This thing is broken, like completely broken, in terms of a way of\nclassifying and identifying what kind of an entity you are,” he says.\n\nMaybe Instagram likes it that way. After all, the platform has helped\nthousands of people monetize otherwise personal content about their lives. The\nboundaries between a money-making entity and a personal scrapbook are gone.\nMicroinfluencers, and even nanoinfluencers (people with only a few thousand\nfollowers on Instagram at most), are now paid to hawk products like makeup and\nshampoo. Are these accounts actual businesses, in the traditional sense? Maybe\nnot, but they often have access to the same analytics as one.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n* The strange life and\n\nmysterious death of a virtuoso coder\n\n",

Apparently, Destiny\n2 isn’t the only game not offering the visual quality Google promised – it's\nrevealed in Eurogamer’s Stadia review that Red Dead Redemption 2 only renders\nat 1440p and 30fps with visual settings at around the same level seen on the\nXbox One X. So, a little better than Destiny 2, but not the top-of-the-line\nexperience we were told to expect. Presumably, other games also offer less-\nthan-ideal visual performance.\n\nOf course, streaming games at 1080p/1440p with high-end console settings isn’t\n_terrible_. If you’re not a particularly techy person and just looking at\nStadia as a replacement for consoles, it’s not a bad alternative. That said,\nGoogle promised more, and for whatever reason, they’re not delivering yet.\nHopefully they can work the kinks out and offer a true high-end experience\nsoon.\n\nThe Google Stadia Founder’s and Premiere Editions, which come with a\nChromecast Ultra, launch tomorrow (November 19) in 14 countries, including\nUnited States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy,\nSpain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.

        "articleBody": "\n\nIf a sci-fi spaceship does not come with hyperdrive then it is usually fitted\nwith hibernation capsules instead. In movies from 2001: A Space Odyssey to\nEvent Horizon, Alien to Passengers, fictional astronauts get put into\n\"suspended animation\" to cross the vastness of space. Now ESA has investigated\nhow real life crew hibernation would impact space mission design.\n\nHuman hibernation has been the subject of initial research within the\nDiscovery element of ESA's Basic Activities, then recommended as a key\n\"enabling technology\" for space by the Agency's Future Technology Advisory\nPanel, resulting in a dedicated \"Topical Team\" on hibernation.\n\nNow the Agency's SciSpacE team has called in ESA's Concurrent Design\nFacility—a multimedia facility enabling expert teams to perform initial\nevaluations of proposed future missions—to assess the advantages of human\nhibernation for a trip to a neighboring planet, such as Mars.\n\nBeginning with an assessment on the current state of the art in human\nhibernation, with the help of ESA Topical Team scientists from Ludwig\nMaximilian University of Munich and the University of Goethe, Frankfurt, the\nCDF team went to investigate for the first time the potential impact of\nhibernation on system-level mission design. They took as their reference an\nexisting mission study to send six humans to Mars and back in a five year\ntimescale.\n\n\"We worked on adjusting the architecture of the spacecraft, its logistics,\nprotection against radiation, power consumption and overall mission design,\"\ncomments Robin Biesbroek of the CDF.\n\n\n\n\"We looked at how an astronaut team could be best put into hibernation, what\nto do in case of emergencies, how to handle human safety and even what impact\nhibernation would have on the psychology of the team. Finally we created an\ninitial sketch of the habitat architecture and created a roadmap to achieve a\nvalidated approach to hibernate humans to Mars within 20 years.\"\n\nThe study found the spacecraft mass could be reduced by a third by removing\nthe crew quarters with a similar reduction in consumables, equivalent to\nseveral tons of saved mass. Hibernation would take place in small individual\npods that would double as cabins while the crew are awake.\n\nThe assumption was that a drug would be administered to induce \"torpor\"—the\nterm for the hibernating state. Like hibernating animals, the astronauts would\nbe expected to acquire extra body fat in advance of torpor. Their soft-shell\npods would be darkened and their temperature greatly reduced to cool their\noccupants during their projected 180-day Earth-Mars cruise.\n\nThe hibernating cruise phase would end with a 21 day recuperation\nperiod—although based on the experience of animal hibernation, the expectation\nwould be that the crew would not experience bone or muscle wastage.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiation exposure from high-energy particles is a key hazard of deep space\ntravel, but because the hibernating crew will be spending so much time in\ntheir hibernation pods, then shielding—such as water containers—could be\nconcentrated around them. And existing research into hibernation shows it\ngives enhanced radiation protection in its own right.\n\nBut with all the crew incapacitated for extended periods of time, the mission\nwould have to be designed for largely autonomous operations, with optimum use\nof artificial intelligence and \"fault detection, isolation and recovery\" to\nmaintain a minimum level of system performance until the crew could be\nrevived.\n\n\"For a while now hibernation has been proposed as a game-changing tool for\nhuman space travel,\" explains SciSpacE Team Leader Jennifer Ngo-Anh. \"If we\nwere able to reduce an astronaut's basic metabolic rate by 75% – similar to\nwhat we can observe in nature with large hibernating animals such as certain\nbears—we could end up with substantial mass and cost savings, making long-\nduration exploration missions more feasible.\n\n\"And the basic idea of putting astronauts into long-duration hibernation is\nactually not so crazy: a broadly comparable method has been tested and applied\nas therapy in critical care trauma patients and those due to undergo major\nsurgeries for more than two decades. Most major medical centers have protocols\nfor inducing hypothermia in patients to reduce their metabolism to basically\ngain time, keeping patients in a better shape than they otherwise would be.\n\n\"We aim to build on this in future, by researching the brain pathways that are\nactivated or blocked during initiation of hibernation, starting with animals\nand proceeding to people.\"\n\nG.

        "articleBody": "With Hong Kong protests exploding to new levels, President Xi Jinping of China\nis likely to deploy Peoples Liberation Army forces onto the former British\ncolony's streets. And that means a slaughter of some degree.\n\nXi's problem is simple. Hong Kong police and their Chinese Ministry of State\nSecurity intelligence service masters are proving unable to stem the mass\ndisorder. In so, painting a picture of political incompetence and security\nimpotence, Hong Kong's street battles are an existential threat to Xi's\nregime. The protests degrade the Chinese Communist Party's claim to a divine\nright of power and weaken Xi's global narrative of a China that is destined to\nlead.\n\nTo be sure, Xi and his comrades on the powerful Standing Committee do not want\nto send the army into Hong Kong.\n\nThey know that doing so would spark immediate international furor and pressure\notherwise China-sympathetic Western interests such as President Emmanuel\nMacron and the NBA to degrade their relationships with Beijing. Yet, neither\ncan Xi allow this chaos to continue. Every day it does, the Communist Party\nappears weaker and thus more vulnerable to that which it most fears:\nresistance to its rule on the mainland and new international resistance to its\nglobal agenda.\n\nAnd Beijing's current strategy for ending the protests is an obvious and\nmanifest failure. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's recent trip to\nBeijing — a trip likely designed to avoid Western intelligence monitoring of\ncommunications — was about Beijing offering new guidance to end the violence.\nBut Beijing's diktats to Lam have achieved nothing but chaos, agitating the\nprotesters into new resistance.\n\nNor has Beijing's backtracking on the extradition law, which sparked the\nprotests cooled protester fury. Propaganda efforts to persuade protesters to\nfall in love with the Communist Party have been similarly catastrophic. A\nrecent face mask ban has also served the opposite effect and was ruled illegal\nby the Hong Kong court system on Monday. That decision by a relatively\nindependent judiciary emphasizes the stakes in this great struggle between\nauthoritarian aggression and the democratic rule of law.\n\nAt the same time, however, those who believe Xi's Communist Party is stuck are\ndeluding themselves.\n\nUnlike us in the West, the Standing Committee views its mission to usurp the\nAmerican-led liberal international order through the prism of generations, not\nyears. Nor does Xi see Hong Kong struggle through a simple microcosm of\nindividual rights versus central power. He sees it as a great test for his\nChinese dream . Forced to choose between a military crackdown, which sparks a\nyear or two of international fury, and Hong Kong's collapse into anarchy, Xi\nwill choose the former.\n\nIn short, slaughter is likely coming to Hong Kong.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\nWritten by Rachael Link, MS, RD — Medically reviewed by Timothy J. Legg,\nPh.D., CRNP — Updated on November 14, 2019\n\nBinge eating disorder (BED) is considered the most common feeding and eating\ndisorder in the United States (1).\n\nBED is about more than food, it’s a recognized psychological condition. That\nmeans people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a\nmedical professional to overcome it.\n\nPeople who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually\nlarge amounts, even when they’re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a\nstrong sense of guilt or shame.\n\nRegular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health\nconditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try — both at home and\nwith the help of a professional — to reduce episodes of binge eating.\n\nHere are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating.\n\n\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\n## 1\\. Ditch the diet\n\nFad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly\nrestrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating.\n\nFor example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was\nassociated with a higher risk of binge eating (2).\n\nSimilarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain\nfoods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating (3).\n\nInstead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or\nsignificantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making\nhealthy changes.\n\nEat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole\ngrains, and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from\nyour diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better\nhealth.\n\n## 2\\. Avoid skipping meals\n\nSetting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most\neffective ways to overcome binge eating.\n\nSkipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating.\n\nOne small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased\nlevels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater\nextent than eating three meals per day (4).\n\nAnother study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was\nassociated with a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nTry setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it.\n\n## 3\\. Practice mindfulness\n\nMindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying\nattention to how you feel at the moment.\n\nThis technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize\nwhen they no longer feel hungry.\n\nOne review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation\ndecreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating (6).\n\nAnother small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive\nbehavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness (7).\n\nTry listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally,\ntry to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors.\n\n## 4\\. Stay hydrated\n\nDrinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to\ncurb cravings and stop overeating.\n\nIn fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to\ndecreased hunger and calorie intake.\n\nFor example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500\nml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by\n13%, compared with a control group (8).\n\nSimilarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13–17 ounces\n(375–500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger\nand calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day (9).\n\nOther studies indicate that drinking more water can boost metabolism and\nweight loss (10, 11).\n\nThe amount of water each person should drink daily depends on various factors.\nThus, it’s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty to\nensure you’re staying well hydrated.\n\n## 5\\. Try yoga\n\nYoga is a practice that incorporates both the body and mind by using specific\nbreathing exercises, poses, and meditation to reduce stress and enhance\nrelaxation.\n\nStudies indicate that yoga can help encourage healthy eating habits and reduce\nthe risk of emotional eating.\n\nOne small study in 50 people with BED showed that practicing yoga for 12 weeks\nled to a significant reduction in binging (12).\n\nAnother study in 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating\ndisorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and body image disturbances\n— all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating (13).\n\nResearch also shows that yoga can decrease levels of stress hormones like\ncortisol to keep stress under control and prevent binge eating (14, 15).\n\nTry joining a local yoga studio to start adding this type of exercise to your\nroutine. You can also use online resources and videos to practice at home.\n\n## 6\\. Eat more fiber\n\nFiber moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full\nlonger (16).\n\nSome research suggests that increasing fiber intake could cut cravings, reduce\nappetite, and food intake.\n\nOne small, 2-week study found that supplementing twice daily with a type of\nfiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing\nfullness (17).\n\nAnother study in 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of prebiotic fiber\ndaily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and\nsignificantly reduced feelings of hunger (18).\n\nFruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few fiber-rich foods\nthat can keep you feeling full.\n\n## 7\\. Clean out the kitchen\n\nHaving lots of junk food or trigger foods in the kitchen can make it much\neasier to binge eat.\n\nConversely, keeping healthy foods on hand can reduce your risk of emotional\neating by limiting the number of unhealthy options.\n\nStart by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-\npackaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives.\n\nStocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole\ngrains, nuts, and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of binge\neating unhealthy foods.\n\n## 8\\. Start hitting the gym\n\nStudies indicate that adding exercise to your routine could prevent binge\neating.\n\nFor instance, one 6-month study in 77 people showed that increasing weekly\nexercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants (19).\n\nAnother study in 84 women found that pairing cognitive behavioral therapy with\nregular exercise was significantly more effective at reducing the frequency of\nbinge eating than therapy alone (20).\n\nPlus, other research suggests that exercise can decrease stress levels and\nenhance mood to prevent emotional eating (21).\n\nWalking, running, swimming, biking, and playing sports are just a few\ndifferent forms of physical activity that can help relieve stress and reduce\nbinge eating.\n\n## 9\\. Eat breakfast every day\n\nStarting each day off with a healthy breakfast might reduce the risk of binge\neating later in the day.\n\nSeveral studies have found that maintaining a regular eating pattern is\nassociated with less binge eating and lower levels of ghrelin, the hormone\nthat stimulates feelings of hunger (4, 5).\n\nPlus, filling up on the right foods can keep you feeling full to curb cravings\nand reduce hunger throughout the day.\n\nFor example, one study in 15 people found that eating a high-protein breakfast\nreduced levels of ghrelin to a greater extent than eating a high carb\nbreakfast (22).\n\nMeanwhile, eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal was shown to improve\nappetite control and promote fullness in another study in 48 people (23).\n\nTry combining a few fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole\ngrains, with a good source of protein to avoid overeating.\n\n## 10\\. Get enough sleep\n\nSleep affects your hunger levels and appetite, and sleep deprivation may be\nlinked to binge eating.\n\nIn fact, one study in 146 people found that those with BED reported\nsignificantly more symptoms of insomnia than people without a history of this\ncondition (24).\n\nAnother large study showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with\nhigher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of leptin — the\nhormone responsible for promoting fullness.\n\nAdditionally, sleeping less than 8 hours per night was linked to higher body\nweight (25).\n\nAim to squeeze in at least 8 hours per night to keep your appetite in check\nand reduce your risk of binge eating.\n\n## 11\\. Keep a food and mood journal\n\nKeeping a food and mood journal that tracks what you eat and how you feel can\nbe an effective tool. It can help identify potential emotional and food\ntriggers and promote healthier eating habits.\n\nOne study in 17 people showed that using an online self-help program that\ninvolved keeping a food diary was associated with fewer self-reported episodes\nof binge eating (26).\n\nSeveral other studies also suggest that tracking your intake may be linked to\nincreased weight loss and aid long-term weight management (27, 28, 29).\n\nTo get started, simply start recording what you eat and how you feel each day\nusing either a journal or app.\n\n## 12\\. Find someone to talk to\n\nTalking to a friend or peer when you feel like binging may help reduce your\nlikelihood of overeating.\n\nOne study in 101 adolescents undergoing sleeve gastrectomy showed that\nreliable social support was associated with less binge eating (30).\n\nAnother study in 125 women with obesity found that better social support was\nlinked to decreased binge eating severity (31).\n\nA good social support system is thought to reduce the impact of stress, which\nmay help decrease your risk of other coping habits like emotional eating (32,\n33).\n\nNext time you feel like binge eating, pick up the phone and call a trusted\nfriend or family member. If you don’t have someone to talk to, eating disorder\nhelplines are available free of charge.\n\n## 13\\. Increase your protein intake\n\nUpping your intake of protein-rich foods can keep you feeling full and help\ncontrol your appetite.\n\nOne study in 19 people showed that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30%\nled to significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, as well as\ndecreased daily calorie intake by an average of 441 calories (34).\n\nSimilarly, another study found that following a high-protein diet enhanced\nmetabolism, promoted feelings of fullness, and increased levels of glucagon-\nlike peptide 1 (GLP-1), a hormone known for its ability to suppress appetite\n(35).\n\nTry including at least one good source of protein — such as meat, eggs, nuts,\nseeds, or legumes — in each meal and enjoy high-protein snacks when you feel\nhungry to keep cravings at bay.\n\n## 14\\. Plan meals\n\nPlanning meals can help ensure that you have healthy ingredients on hand to\nprepare nutritious meals. Also, measuring out portion sizes and putting the\nremainder of food away may help you avoid triggering a binge.\n\nIn fact, one study in over 40,000 adults showed that meal planning was\nassociated with improvements in diet quality and variety, as well as a lower\nrisk of obesity (36).\n\nMeal planning also makes it easier to stick to a regular eating pattern, which\nhas been linked to a decreased frequency of binge eating (5).\n\nSet aside an hour or two each week to plan out a weekly rotation for your\nmeals.\n\n## 15\\. Seek help\n\nWhile the strategies above can be helpful, oftentimes a treatment plan\ndesigned by a professional is needed to help overcome binging.\n\nTreatment for BED can involve different types of therapy or medications to\nhelp get binging under control and treat any underlying causes or symptoms.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, the most effective form of therapy, explores the\nconnection between your thoughts, feelings, and eating patterns and then\ndevelops strategies to modify your behavior (37).\n\nOther types of therapy used to treat binge eating include dialectical\nbehavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral weight loss\ntherapy (37).\n\nAntidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and certain stimulants are also\nsometimes used to treat BED, though more research is needed to evaluate the\nlong-term effects of these medications (38, ).\n\n## The bottom line\n\nis a recognized psychological condition that affects millions of people around\nthe world.\n\nHowever, it’s possible to overcome it with the right treatment plan and\nhealthy lifestyle modifications.\n\n_Editor’s note: This piece was originally published on Sept. 17, 2018.

        "articleBody": "\n\nThree cases of plague have been diagnosed in China, sparking widespread fears\nabout the spread of the disease, though officials say the risk of an outbreak\nis low.\n\nAs Emily Feng reports for _NPR_ , the first cases came to light last week,\nwhen authorities in Beijing announced that two infected individuals sought\ntreatment at a hospital in the capital. The patients, a husband and wife, are\nfrom Inner Mongolia, an autonomous and sparsely populated region in the\nnorthern part of the country. They were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, one\nof the two main forms of infection caused by the bacteria _Yersinia pestis_\n—the other being bubonic plague, which can advance to pneumonic plague if the\ninfection spreads to the lungs. _Yersinia pestis_ , per the WHO, is often\nfound in small mammals and their fleas.\n\nPneumonic plague is the most deadly form of the disease. It is highly\ncontagious, spreading from person to person via infected respiratory droplets.\nWithout medical intervention, the disease is inevitably fatal. But recovery\nrates are high if it is detected and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours\nof the onset of symptoms.\n\nThe ailing couple was quarantined, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control\nand Prevention said it had conducted epidemiological investigations on people\nwho might have been exposed to the patients, according to Sui-Lee Wee of the\n_New York Times_ _._ All “relevant sites” were also disinfected, reports Wee.\nThe CDC assured the public on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media site, that\nthe risks of transmission were “extremely low.”\n\nOn November 16, a third case of plague was reported in a 55-year-old man, also\nfrom Inner Mongolia. He had, according to Alex Horton of the _Washington Post_\n, killed and eaten a wild rabbit before he was taken to a hospital around 185\nmiles northwest of Beijing. The man was diagnosed with bubonic plague.\n\nThe _Associated Press_ reports that 28 people who came into contact with the\npatient were quarantined, and displayed no symptoms of plague—like the sudden\nonset of fever, body aches, vomiting and nausea. As yet, there is no\nepidemiological evidence linking the third plague case to the earlier two, the\nInner Mongolia health commission said, according to _Reuters_.\n\nOver the centuries, plague has killed millions of people around the world,\nmost famously during the Black Death, which wiped out nearly one-third of\nEurope’s population in the 1300s. _Yersinia pestis_ is believed to have\noriginated in China, spreading to the West via ships. Today, plague infections\nare rare, but they do happen. According to WHO, there were 3,248 cases\nreported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, with 584 deaths. China has\nexperienced a small smattering of plague infections in recent years—26 cases\nand 11 deaths between 2009 and 2018, reports _Reuters._\n\nThough the government has attempted to reassure the Chinese public in the wake\nof the recent diagnoses, many have voiced concerns that officials are\nminimizing or even restricting information about the cases.\n\nThe first two illnesses were confirmed on November 12. But according to _NPR_\n’s Feng, Li Jifeng, a doctor at Chaoyang Hospital where the patients were\ntreated, wrote in a blog post that the couple had been transported to the\nfacility on November 3—nine days before an announcement was made, raising\nquestions about the reason for the delay.\n\nLi explained that plague cases need to be carefully investigated and verified,\nand announcements about them cannot be “transmitted casually.” But her post\nwas still taken down by censors. Wee of the _Times_ reports that censors had\nalso instructed digital news aggregators to “block and control” discussions\npertaining the news about the plague.\n\n“Don't hide things like this,” one Weibo commenter said, per Feng. “Let’s face\nwhatever it is together.”\n\nCurrent fears about a potential plague outbreak are perhaps being fuelled by\nChina’s handling of past health crises. In 2003, authorities there were\naccused of concealing the true extent of the country’s SARS outbreak—and\nBeijing officials ultimately admitted that the city had experienced 10 times\nas many cases as they had initially reported.\n\nIn the wake of that outbreak, China “vastly improved its detection and\nmanagement of infectious diseases,” writes the _Associated Press_. And though\nthe Chinese CDC has said that there is “no need” for Beijing residents to\nworry about the risk of plague infection, it has also acknowledged that remote\nregions of the country—like Yunnan and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau—are\nvulnerable to outbreaks. Officials have warned people to stay away from\ninfected areas, and to avoid contact with rodents.\n\n",

News.\n\n\"Scooter is frustrated because his name is being dragged in the mud,\" an\ninsider told the outlet on Monday. \"He doesn't run Big Machine or have\noperational control of [the] company. He hasn't taken part in these\nnegotiations.\"\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record\nlabel, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 – who reps the likes of Justin Beiber,\nDemi Lovato and Ariana Grande – has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29,\nhowever the “Bad Blood” songstress allegedly hasn’t been returning Braun’s\ncalls, the source further claimed to the outlet.\n\n\n\nScooter Braun and Scott Borchetta pose for a photo at a private residence on\nJune 28, 2019 in Montecito, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for\nIthaca Holdings)\n\n\"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider\nadded of the continuing spat.\n\nOn Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it\npossible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards\nafter Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned\ncompany of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own\nthe master recordings, at the AMAs\n\nThe statement, which was obtained by Variety, claimed that Big Machine and\nDick Clark Productions had “come to terms on a licensing agreement that\napproves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast\non mutually approved platform.” The agreement maintained that it would not\nonly cover Swift’s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\n\n\n\n\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live\nperformances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is\nonly needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in\ndetermining how those works are distributed,” the statement continued.\n\nHowever, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to\nan agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that\nit had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\n\n\n\nBraun’s Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group, home to Swift’s\nfirst six albums, including the Grammy winners for album of the year, 2008’s\n“Fearless” and 2014’s “1989.” (Photos by Richard Shotwell, left, and Mark Von\nHolden/Invision/AP)\n\n“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or\ndistribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding\nTaylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the production\ncompany said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone. “Any final agreement on\nthis matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We\nhave no further comment.”\n\nOn Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big\nMachine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has\nbeen working on where her music was to be used.\n\nThe company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its\nwebsite.\n\n\n\n\"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her\ntumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read.\n\"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her\nNetflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing\nlive anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have\ncontinued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties\nas she promotes her current record in which we do not financially\nparticipate.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars\nand multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking\nemployees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have\nworked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and\nher team to productively move forward.\n\n\n\n\"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as\nrecently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our\npersistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution,\nTaylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a\ncalculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their\nfamilies,\" the statement concluded.\n\nSwift's rep told Fox News that this, too, was not the whole truth. \"Big\nMachine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them\nbut, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes\nTaylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"\n\nA rep for Braun did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.\n\nFox News’ Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "January 23, 2020| BY: Ilana Muhlstein, MS, RDN\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2020Ilana Muhlstein, MS, RDN\n\nIf you’re like me and you don’t follow football throughout the season, you can\nalways find something to love about game day — whether it’s rooting for the\nunderdog, enjoying the halftime show and commercials, or just having a good\ntime with friends and family.\n\nAs co-creator of the weight-loss program 2B Mindset, I want to help you enjoy\neverything about game day, including those delicious snacks!\n\nFootball food is “comfort food” — pizza, wings, chips, dips, and subs — and\nthey can be very hard to resist.\n\nBut it’s important to remember that we’re fueling our bodies to watch\nfootball, not actually play it!\n\n## 5 Tips to Enjoy Game Day Parties While Staying on Track With Your Weight-\nLoss Goals:\n\n### 1\\. Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\n\nI know — it all looks so good. But you can’t eat it all, so it’s time to set\npriorities.\n\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks — those that are vegetable-based, low in\nfat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full,\nso you’re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\n\nAnd you don’t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just\nchoose the one or two indulgences you just can’t live without and leave it at\nthat.\n\n### 2\\. Don’t forget to drink water\n\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even\nhelp prevent a hangover), so if you’re drinking beer, wine, or anything else\nalcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer\nwith a large glass of water.\n\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy\ninstead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just\nbecause they’re there.\n\n### 3\\. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\n\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we’re\nfeeling especially hungry.\n\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\n\nThat’s especially true when you’re watching TV: A handful of chips and\nguacamole here, a chicken wing or two there — and without realizing it, you’ve\nconsumed several hundred calories without even enjoying your food, let alone\nfeeling full or satisfied.\n\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate,\nand eat from there.\n\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you’re eating,\nand to help you pace yourself so that you don’t overdo it.\n\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don’t let your fingers do the walking.\n\n\n\n### 4\\. “Veggie-fy” your chips ‘n’ dip\n\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy\ndip.\n\nBut instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a vegetable instead.\n\nBecause let’s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the\nfact that it’s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\n\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up\nyour favorite dip and you’ll see that you’ll still get all the flavor and\ncrunchy satisfaction you want!\n\nAnd don’t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has\naround four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or\nmayonnaise-based dip — those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\n\n**Healthy Game Day Dip:** Mix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with\ntwo tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories.\n\nEnjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you’ll get plenty of tangy crunch —\nwithout all the calories.\n\n### 5\\. Go topless (with your sub)\n\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both\nsides of the sandwich.\n\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you’re saving nearly 100 calories —\nabout the same as a bottle of light beer.\n\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats?\n\nThis is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to\ntell yourself “no.” That’s why I always tell my clients: “An open face is a\nhappy face!”\n\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you’re out\nat a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the\ngreat company, and yes, even the game day snacks — without overdoing it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information provided on this website (including the Blogs, Community\npages, Program Materials and all other content) was originally intended for a\nUS audience.

        "articleBody": "\n\n\n\nYour “success mindset” matters. Here’s why:\n\nThere’s a strange disconnect in the online business world.\n\nOnline business owners tend to be _introverts._\n\nI mean, really … it’s the perfect job for an introvert!\n\nYou can do your work all by yourself without needing to interact with a single\nperson in real life. Your computer screen provides comfort and cover from the\nworld outside your doors.\n\nAnd despite the fact that you’re working alone, your business can flourish.\n\nBut here’s the disconnect …\n\nYou have to be willing to be a _leader_.\n\n## Welcome to a discussion about online leadership — and how to embrace it\n\nToday, we’re going to talk about how to adapt a success mindset so you’re able\nto step into a leadership role in your online business naturally and with\nease.\n\nBut more importantly, I’m going to show you how taking a leadership role will\nhelp you to create a business you’ll love — a business that may not look like\nanyone else’s, but that suits you 100%.\n\n\n\n## Here’s why stepping into an online leadership role is crucial\n\n_“Pamela, why are we talking about leadership?”_\n\nI’ve been thinking about leadership a lot this year. I’ve realized that it’s\nan essential ingredient of online success that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe sooner you embrace your online leader role, the sooner you’ll enjoy these\nbenefits:\n\n* You’ll feel\n\n**poised and self-assured while doing all the promotional activities**\n\n* that come with owning an online business.\n\n* You’ll become\n\n**comfortable being visible online**\n\n* in everything from a published blog post; an email inbox; a webinar; a live video; a podcast; a stage; and inside the pages of a book.\n\n* Your business will grow, because\n\n**the online world rewards people who confidently stand behind and in front of\ntheir businesses.**\n\nI’m about to show you a path forward that even the most introverted among us\ncan walk. It’s a way to gradually shift your success mindset so it includes\nopportunities to be the online leader your business needs.\n\nIf you …\n\n* Want to share your expertise with the world — but you’re secretly terrified to “put yourself out there”\n\n* Feel a deep desire to build a business that makes a difference but aren’t sure what it’s going to take\n\n* Wish you had tens of thousands of people in your audience — but are intimidated by those numbers at the same time\n\n… keep reading. I’m about to show you how to become an online business leader\nnaturally and with less stress and fear.\n\n## How a success mindset helps you triumph online\n\nThis is the second article in a series about how to build an online business\nyou’ll love.\n\nIn the first article, I talked about how online businesses are built in\npredictable stages.\n\nI shared a quiz that helps you pinpoint the stage you’re in now.\n\nThe BIG benefit of knowing your business-building stage?\n\nIt allows you to focus all your efforts on reaching the important milestones\nin that stage … and gives you permission to ignore the stages you’re not in\nright now.\n\nSay goodbye to that feeling of overwhelm you’ve been carrying around!\n\n**Related: Why Some People Triumph Online and Others Never Make It**\n\nToday, I’m going to build on what I shared in the first article by showing you\nhow to shift your “success mindset” toward growth. I’m going to map out an\neasy path to becoming the online leader your business needs.\n\nI think you’ll like what you’re about to learn. There’s a way to do this\nthat’s not stressful and that builds naturally from one experience to another.\n\nMy goal with this article is to show you a way to become more comfortable\nstanding both _behind_ and _in front of_ the online business you’re building.\nReady?\n\n\n\n## Have you experienced these “moments of personal growth?”\n\nAny time you’re building a business — online or offline — you’re going to\nexperience some moments that cause you to … well, let’s say they _cause you to\ngrow as a person._\n\nThat’s putting a pleasant spin on it, isn’t it?\n\nMaybe you’ve experienced these moments before:\n\n* You’re putting together a first offer and then it hits you — “Oh, if I want people to buy this, I have to\n\n_market_\n\n* it … not just now, but forever!”\n\n* You know that in order to\n\n_reach_\n\n* prospects you’ve got to\n\n_extend yourself._\n\n* But yikes … outreach is so uncomfortable!\n\n* You’re given opportunities to be more visible — maybe it’s an interview request or a small speaking gig — and you’re terrified to say “yes.”\n\nIf you’ve experienced any of these challenging moments, guess what? You’re\nnormal! And they help to form your success mindset.\n\nBut if you stay stuck in these moments and don’t move beyond them, your\nbusiness won’t become what it can be.\n\nYour introverted side will stay cozy and comfortable, that’s for sure.\n\nBut you will always wonder, _“What would have happened if I’d experienced the\nmomentary discomfort and pushed past it?”_\n\nThat’s what we’re going to cover here: a way to embrace a success mindset and\npush beyond the momentary discomfort so you can experience everything that’s\nwaiting for you on the other side.\n\n\n\n## Beware the deep end\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s talk about the deep end for a moment.\n\nThere are a lot of people online who are pushing their solutions for gaining\nvisibility in your online business. They’re selling:\n\n* Courses on writing a book\n\n* Workshops on becoming a highly paid speaker\n\n* Classes on running successful webinars\n\n_These are all good things._ They’re all things I’ve done myself! But if you\ntake courses on doing these “deep end” things before you’ve done some of the\n“shallow end” things I’m about to share, you may end up feeling intimidated —\nnot inspired.\n\nAnd sadly, you may never take the first steps.\n\nThat’s what I’m about to cover … _the first steps._ They’re crucial!\n\nRead on for three tips that will help you build a firm foundation for online\nleadership so that courses like the ones above feel like a natural next step.\n\n### 1\\. Start small and recognize that no one is watching\n\nHere’s an analogy:\n\nWhen you’re in the planning and in the early building stages of your online\nbusinesses — planning your website and offers, and building the first-draft\nversions of both — there’s a helpful way to think about what you’re doing.\n\nImagine you’re in an auditorium in the backstage area, and the curtains are\ndrawn. No one in the audience can see what you’re doing back there!\n\nYou’re planning and building what you’ll reveal to the world — but you haven’t\npulled back the curtains and invited them in.\n\nHere’s what I want you to remember …\n\nWhen you do finally pull back those curtains with your heart in your throat\nand sweat beading on your upper lip?\n\n_No one is watching._\n\nI mean, if you’re lucky a few family members and friends are in your audience\nin the early days. But for the most part? There’s almost no one there.\n\nIt’s the perfect time to explore making yourself more visible. With fewer\npeople watching your first visibility attempts, you won’t feel as intimidated\nby the process.\n\nSo start small and experiment! More on ways to experiment in the next section\n…\n\n### 2\\. Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1\n\nA few years ago, I was honored to be asked to speak twice at Darren Rowse’s\nProblogger conference in Australia. The topic of one of my presentations was\ncreating online “events” that build your audience.\n\nIn that presentation I talked about how the online world gives you many\nopportunities to step out of your comfort zone.\n\nAnd I used this highly scientific graphic to illustrate the idea:\n\n\n\nIt got a good laugh! And I made my point, which is …\n\nIt’s smart to start with less-intimidating things and work your way up to the\nmore intimidating things.\n\nIncreasing your visibility gradually lets you grow into your online leadership\nrole with much less stress.Click To Tweet\n\nEveryone’s list will be different. For me, the online visibility spectrum used\nto look like this:\n\n#### NOT SCARY\n\n* Writing a blog post\n\n* Writing a piece of email marketing\n\n* Speaking to someone on the phone\n\n#### KIND OF SCARY\n\n* Publishing the blog post\n\n* Sending the piece of email marketing\n\n* Speaking to someone on a video call\n\n#### INTIMIDATING\n\n* Participating in a podcast interview\n\n* Speaking as a member of a panel\n\n* Presenting a live webinar\n\n#### TERROR LEVEL 100\n\n* Delivering the keynote speech at a conference\n\n* Hosting a live video on a social media platform\n\n* Publishing and promoting a book\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nI didn’t go from the **Non-scary** stuff to the **Terror Level 100** list.\n\nInstead, I moved from the **Non-scary** to the **Kind of Scary** stuff. I\nmastered the **Kind of Scary** list and moved on to the **Intimidating** list.\nI got comfortable with the **Intimidating** list and found myself ready to\ntackle the **Terror Level 100** list.\n\nAll the while, my visibility increased. My success mindset became more\nresilient.\n\nAs you push into your next level of discomfort, you’ll find yourself being\nasked to participate in highly visible online events. People will ask you to\nwrite blog posts for them; appear on their podcasts; deliver the keynote\naddresses at their conferences.\n\nThe good news?\n\nYou’ll have a strong success mindset and you’ll be ready for it all.\n\n### 3\\. Get support for the scary stuff to strengthen your success mindset\n\nWe already talked about how introverts can thrive online.\n\nWe sit alone at our screens, crafting information and messages that reach\nacross the world and draw an audience to us … without having to leave the\ncomfort of our homes, if we don’t want to.\n\nBut sitting in comfort stops you from growing into an online leadership role\nthat will benefit you _and_ your business.\n\nWhen it comes to moving yourself along the “visibility spectrum” toward a\nleadership role, it’s incredibly helpful to have a group of supportive\ncolleagues by your side. People who share your dreams; empathize with your\nfrustrations; and are generous with their support.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve reached out to colleagues and said\nsomething along the lines of …\n\n_“Argh! I know I need to do this but it’s scary!”_\n\nHaving a team of people around you that you can be “real” with is vital if you\nwant to move yourself along that visibility spectrum.\n\n## Here’s how to switch up your success mindset and become the online leader\nyour business needs\n\nLet’s quickly recap what we covered in this article:\n\n**Start small and recognize that no one is watching.**\n\n* The early days are the perfect time to explore things that feel uncomfortable — your audience is small and you won’t feel as intimidated.\n\n**Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1**\n\n* . Remember, online leadership and authoritative visibility exist on a spectrum. Move along it step-by-step and your confidence will grow naturally.\n\n**Get support for the scary stuff.**\n\n* If you are truly committed to growth, consider joining a group where the other members will have your back and offer support when you’re about to take a big, scary step.\n\n“Become an online leader” sounds like a tall order. But it doesn’t have to be!\nTake it step-by-step and get support for the hard parts and you’ll get there\nbefore you know it.\n\n### Share this information, please?\n\nA favor: would you take a moment to share this information?\n\nAs I said earlier, I don’t see anyone else talking about how building up to an\nonline leadership role will grow your business — and how to do it with less\nstress.\n\nI’d really love to get this information out to more people, so if you can take\na moment to share, I’d appreciate it.\n\n### Coming next: how to make Plan & Grow BIG work for your business\n\nIn the final article in this series, we’re going to dig deep into how the Plan\n& Grow BIG approach to building an online business really works — and how to\nput it to use in your business.\n\nIt’s all about finding your starting point and focusing on the milestones that\nare just ahead.\n\n* If you’re just starting out, I’ll show you the path to take to get your online business off to a great start.\n\n* If you’ve already built your online business but it hasn’t reached its full potential, you’ll discover some new ideas for skyrocketing your growth.\n\n### Go forth and lead\n\nNow you know a natural progression you can use to step into an online\nleadership role that will grow your reach and your revenues.\n\nIf you’re ready to build and grow your online business, check out the BIG\nLeague — my self-paced program for online business builders — and download the\nOnline Business Success Roadmap.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I started out, making my website live was the scary level, Pamela.\nFortunately I had already been blogging for 6 months before that on Blogger so\nwriting posts was easy and once my website was up, I enjoyed looking at my\nGoogle Analytics (I had transferred my blog to the website by then).\n\nThe next scary step was learning to share my blog posts which was strange\nsince I had no trouble getting on the phone to discuss business or going out\nand doing live workshops.\n\nI feel we all have our different comfort and dis-comfort zones and mapping a\nprogressive journey that will build on our growing comfort level is important.\nNowadays social sharing is fun and I’m looking out for other ways to share my\nmessage.

        "articleBody": "President Donald Trump, according to the White House, made an unscheduled trip\nto Walter Reed hospital on Saturday for a “quick exam and labs” as the first\nstage of his annual physical.\n\nYou shouldn’t just believe them.\n\n\n\nWhich is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn’t minor or maybe\neven routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House\nwho have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation – up to and including\nthe President’s health – that should force any rational person to question the\nexplanation currently being offered by the White House.\n\nRemember what we already know about this President’s health. Trump is 73 years\nold and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his\nmost recent physical exam – conducted in February – he clocked in at 243\npounds.\n\nIn his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a\ncommon form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN’s chief medical\ncorrespondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump’s heart disease meant\nthat the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5\nyears, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic.)\n\nAt the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as\nthe President’s physician, suggested that the President change his diet and\nget on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is\nvery little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources\ntold CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food\nintake and exercise habits.\n\n“The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual\nphysical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,” said\nHogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\n\nNow consider what we know about Trump’s visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It\nwas unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule\nand was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up\nthat a “VIP” guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House\npress secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a\njump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or\nover multiple days in the past two years.\n\nSo, there’s reason – lots of it! – to wonder. Especially when you consider\nthat Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor’s reports in the\npast.\n\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential\nprimary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold\nBornstein.\n\n“His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,” Bornstein wrote of\nTrump. “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the\nhealthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.”\n\nIf it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it’s because he had!\nBornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump “dictated that whole letter. I didn’t\nwrite that letter. I just made it up as I went along.”\n\nSo, the paper-thin medical “record” that Trump provided to quiet questions\nabout whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president\nwas made up. It wasn’t based on Bornstein’s medical judgment. It was Trump\ndoing what he always does – making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n\n(Trump, it’s also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton’s\nhealth an issue in the 2016 campaign – particularly after she was seen feeling\nfaint at a September 11 commemoration.)\n\nGiven that history – and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false\nor misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post’s\nFact Checker – there is every reason to suspect the original story the White\nHouse is telling doesn’t paint the full picture.\n\n“We’re not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to\nthe President, but as my statements said he’s in good health and it was a\nroutine checkup as part of his annual physical,” Grisham told CNN. “I’ve given\nplenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate – actively\ntrying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.”\n\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given\n“plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.” Which,\nof course, means she has given some that, well aren’t.\n\nThis – right here – is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the\ntruth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take\nthe White House’s word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been\nfalse. The answer is that we can’t take their word for it. And neither should\nyou.\n\n",

And don't forget to make a backup plan.\n\n**Visit Business Insider's Investing Reference library for more stories**\n\n* .\n\nThe road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes time and incredible discipline\nto earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\n\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it\nlooks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In\ngeneral, here are the steps you can take:\n\n## How to retire early\n\n### 1\\. Define early retirement\n\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless\nyou want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live —\ni.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job\nfor something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps\nyou'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts\nand travel in between.\n\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what\nthat phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it\neasier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n\n### 2\\. Take inventory\n\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from\nanesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early\nretiree is to take inventory of their finances.\n\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the\nfuture,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net\nworth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be\nable to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking\naccount habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated\ntracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every\nyear.\"\n\n### 3\\. Establish your target number\n\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how\nmuch money you need to make it a reality.\n\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between\n25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's\nworth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to\nAll the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to\ncalculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly,\nand even daily savings goals.\n\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are\nmultiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect\nyour investments. A good financial planner can help you crunch the numbers and\nsend you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal — and even hold you\naccountable, if you want.\n\n### 4\\. Live below your means\n\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more\nthan you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to\nlive below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\n\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing,\ntransportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your\nsavings rate.\n\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three\ncategories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when\nsomeone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\"\nbudget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who\nachieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\n\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US\nhousehold, around $60,000 a year.\n\n### 5\\. Leverage your income\n\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a\ncertain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an\neven bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali\nexplained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your\nexpenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term\nsolution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution,\nthey said.\n\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams.\nThe most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such\nas real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that\ngenerates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you\nmore flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial\nindependence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n\n### 6\\. Max out your retirement accounts\n\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about\nfinancial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings.\nOftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\n\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax\nadvantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000\npretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax\ndeduction on your current year's tax return.\n\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're\nplanning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able\nto take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59\nand a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with\nafter-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings\n— tax-free, at any time.\n\n### 7\\. Invest the money that's left over\n\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account.\nThis is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when\nyou need it.\n\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren\nBuffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-\none investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to\ndiversify your money and minimize risk.\n\n### 8\\. If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\n\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high\ninterest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good\nterms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-\nfree is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest\npayments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\n\nTommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired nearly 10 years ago\nat age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a\nsix-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living\nfrugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his\nbiggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free\ncertainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n\n### 9\\. Research your options for health insurance\n\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's\nhealth insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the\nmost cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is\njoining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\n\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer\nunder COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the\nAffordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting\na part-time job.\n\n### 10\\. Make a backup plan\n\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You\nmay find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go\nback to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it — would\nyou have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios\nis essential when your livelihood is on the line.\n\n### 11\\. Put Plan A into action — but enjoy the present, too\n\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out.\nKeep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you\ncan.\n\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire,\n\"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not _all_ we do, either. It\nis important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those\nsmaller achievements.\"\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\nСредняя суточная калорийность 1694 Ккал.\n\nЭта диета пришла к нам с запада и в своей основе содержит ограничение на\nколичество углеводов. В отличие от всех без исключения остальных диет, диета\nАткинса учитывает индивидуальные особенности именно вашего организма. По сути,\nдиета Аткинса представляет из себя комплекс из собственно диеты и системы\nпитания, (сама диета проводится один раз, а система питания удерживает ваш вес\nв рамках дозволенного).\n\nЭтой диете с успехом следую зарубежные и отечественные знаменитости и видные\nполитические деятели. Тот же принцип использует и знаменитая кремлевская\nдиета. Идеолог диеты, доктор Аткинс, в обязательном порядке требует полное\nвоздержание от каких либо лекарств в период первых двух недель диеты - что,\nскорее всего, потребует консультации с врачом. Ограничение углеводов в диете\nбудет подразумевать снижение сахара в крови - что так же требует консультации\nу врача.\n\nДиета противопоказана: при беременности - может неблагоприятно сказаться на\nребенке, при кормлении грудью - та же причина, имеются почечная\nнедостаточность - колебания уровня сахара и ряд других.\n\nДиета Аткинса является двухфазной - в первую фазу, продолжительность которой\n14 дней, ваш организм будет получать минимально необходимое количество\nуглеводов - что позволит выравнивать баланс калорий за счет расходования\nвнутренних ресурсов из жировых отложений - максимальное снижение веса. По\nистечении 14 дней ограничение на калорийность продуктов снимается, но остается\nограничение на количество углеводов - в этом сложность диеты - максимальное\nзначение определяется индивидуально исходя из особенностей вашего организма -\nпостоянный контроль веса и коррекция баланса углеводов практически на\nпротяжении всей жизни.\n\nНа протяжении двух первых недель количество углеводов не должно превышать 20\nграмм в сутки. Среднее значение этого параметра для большинства людей\nсоставляет около 40 граммов (превышение приведет к ожирению - что и имеет\nместо быть для большинства людей с избыточным весом - потребляемые\nодновременно углеводы и жиры не усваиваются одинаково - углеводы как\nэнергетический источник полностью расходуются на поддержание сегодняшних\nпотребностей, а часть жиров запасается - если имел место быть их излишек - наш\nорганизм только их и способен запасать - такова наша физиология).\n\nЦифра в 20 грамм легко достижима - это всего-навсего 3 чайных ложки сахарного\nпеска в чай или сдобная булочка - поэтому никакого быстрого питания и\nперекусов. Для предотвращения таких ситуаций составлен список разрешенных\nвсегда и в любом количестве (условно) продуктов - понятно, что подразумевается\nваша инициативность - никаких излишеств - кушаем только тогда, когда появилось\nустойчивое чувство голода - никаких чипсов за сериалами.\n\n## Список разрешенных продуктов в меню диеты Аткинса:\n\n* любая рыба (и морская и речная)\n\n* любая птица (включая дичь)\n\n* любые\n\nморепродукты\n\n* (ограничение по количеству на устрицы - но лучше заранее рассчитать рецепт)\n\n* в любом виде яйца (можно и куриные и перепелиные)\n\n* любой твердый сыр (на некоторые сорта ограничение по количеству - заранее рассчитать рецепт)\n\n* все типы овощей (употребление которых можно в сыром виде)\n\n* любые свежие грибы\n\nДополнительное ограничение - нельзя за один прием пищи употреблять дневную\nнорму углеводов в сочетании и с белками (птица, мясо) и с жирами. Необходимо\nвыдержать интервал в 2 часа. На сочетание белки и жиры этого ограничения нет.\n\n## Список запрещенных продуктов:\n\n* алкоголь в любом виде\n\n* жиры искусственного происхождения\n\n* сахар в любом виде (иначе выйдите за пределы дневной нормы по другим продуктам)\n\n* фрукты (во всех большое содержание углеводов - даже в среднем лимоне их почти 5 грамм)\n\n* овощи с большим содержанием крахмала (картофель, кукуруза - рассчитать рецепт)\n\n* кондитерские изделия (все содержат сахар)\n\n* хлебобулочные изделия (большое содержание крахмала)\n\n## Список продуктов с ограничением по количеству\n\n* капуста\n\nнизкокалорийный аналог сметаны\n\n* ) и ряд других продуктов.\n\nПить можно и обычную, и минеральную воду, и чай, и кофе, и Coca-Cola Light -\nлюбой напиток без углеводов (например, стакан виноградного сока содержит почти\n30 грамм углеводов - а это явный перебор суточной нормы).\n\n# Вторая фаза диеты Аткинса\n\nВторая фаза диеты еще более простая - организм уже привыкает к ряду\nограничений, и обмен веществ переориентирован на расходование внутренних\nжировых резервов.\n\nДопустимая суточная норма углеводов приближается примерно к 40 граммам (для\nкаждого человека индивидуально). Но теперь требуется постоянный контроль веса\n- снижение жировых отложений будет продолжаться (но несколько медленнее). Как\nтолько достигните оптимального для вас веса можно понемногу добавлять в меню\nуглеводные продукты - пока вес не начнет увеличиваться - это и будет ваш\nиндивидуальный уровень углеводов (максимальный именно для вас). В дальнейшем\nперейдете этот уровень - начнете набирать вес - и наоборот.\n\nКонечно, в дальнейшем, скорее всего вы допустите некоторые излишества по\nобъективным причинам - например, поездка на отдых, сопровождаемая алкоголем -\nпонятно, что наберете небольшой излишний вес - уменьшите потребление углеводов\nдо 20 грамм в сутки - как в первой фазе - пока не приведете свой вес к норме.\n\n# Достоинства диеты Аткинса\n\nС одной стороны диета крайне простая и легко выполнимая - ограничения\nнесущественны и легко выполнимы. Разрешенные диетой продукты включают\nпродукты, полностью запрещенные в других диетах (сметана, яйца, сыр, мясо и\nмясные изделия). Диета Аткинса высокоэффективная - следуя ее рекомендациям, вы\nмедленно, но верно будете сбрасывать вес до нормы. Несомненным плюсом диеты\nАткинса является нормализация режима питания и обмена веществ. Сюда же нужно\nотнести и отсутствие ограничений на число и время приемов пищи.\n\n# Недостатки диеты Аткинса\n\nДиета Аткинса не является полностью сбалансированной (но в этом плане она в\nразы превосходит другие диеты) - возможно, может потребоваться дополнительный\nприем витамино-минеральных комплексов. Минусом диеты Аткинса является ее\nпродолжительность - всю жизнь контролировать баланс углеводов. Конечно,\nотрицательно для этой диеты сказывается и необходимость предварительного\nрасчета рецептов по таблицам.\n\n",

        "articleBody": "\n\nPublished Tue, Nov 19 20197:05 AM ESTUpdated Tue, Nov 19 20197:16 AM EST\n\nBeauty company Coty is breaking out — in a good way.\n\nThe stock added more than 2% to begin the week after the beauty brand took a\nmajority stake in Kylie Jenner's cosmetics company in a deal worth $600\nmillion. Those gains add to a major gain for shares, climbing more than 80% so\nfar this year.\n\nMatt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, says the stock could be a risky\nbet with a worthy reward.\n\n\"This is a stock that until this year had been getting clobbered,\" Maley said\non CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Monday. \"It was down for four straight years,\ndown well over 60%, and the rally has only just recently broken above that\nmultiyear trend line. If it can take it a little bit further and break above\n$13.60, that will follow that upward break of the trend line with a very nice\nhigher high and will confirm that its long-term trend has broken to the\nupside.\"\n\n\"A little bit more risk but more reward because whenever you buy any stock in\nthe early stages of a change in trend, it always gives you a little more\nupside potential,\" Maley said.\n\nThe Coty-Kylie Jenner deal could be the beginning of a new trend for consumer-\nfacing stocks, says John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset\nManagement.\n\n\"Here's a company that's willing to pay for the eyeballs and the followers\nthat Kylie Jenner has more so than anything else. So, this could be a new\nparadigm for the consumer staples, packaged goods industry which, you know,\nhas been suffering because of weak mall traffic and the rise of e-commerce\nbecause shelf space has basically become infinite,\" Petrides said during the\nsame segment.\n\nCoty acquired a 51% ownership position in Jenner's beauty and cosmetics\nportfolio, a deal announced at the beginning of the week. Jenner still has a\npartnership with Ulta Beauty to sell her products in its stores. That\nrelationship began last November and led to several quarters of revenue growth\nfor Ulta.\n\n\"I would expect more acquisitions like this going forward because it could be\nthe new model for companies to acquire top-line growth by partnering up with\nkey influencers,\" Petrides said.\n\nDisclaimer\n\n",
