        "articleBody": "The Steelers spent Monday trying to distance themselves from Thursday night's fight that led to multi-game suspensions for Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett and Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey . Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also received a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines. \nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson , however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight on Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his role in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet. \nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. … You get what's coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine Rudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds . \nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more focused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game winning streak come to an end. \n\"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette . \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of things, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much. That's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to learn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\nThe Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as the NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25 kickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to facing the Browns again. \n\"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I don't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot [again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at home, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got to put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game, so our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"",

        "articleBody": "JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Legendary South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela has died at the age of 78 after a decade-long fight with cancer, according to a statement from his family on Tuesday.\nOften called the “Father of South African jazz,” Masekela died in Johannesburg after what his family said was a “protracted and courageous battle with prostate cancer.”\nTrumpeter, singer and composer Masekela, affectionately known locally as “Bra Hugh,” started playing the horn at 14 and quickly became an integral part of the 1950s jazz scene in Johannesburg as a member of the Jazz Epistles.\nIn the 1960s he went into exile in the United Kingdom and the United States, where he collaborated with American jazz legend Harry Belafonte and used his music to spread awareness about the oppressive system of white-minority rule in South Africa. He also scored an international number one hit in 1968 with “Grazing In The Grass.”\nHe collaborated with many musicians including Paul Simon and Herb Alpert. He was married to South African singer and activist Miriam Makeba for two years.\nMany of his compositions were about the struggle for majority rule and full democratic rights in South Africa. Masekela’s catchy composition “Bring Him Back Home” calling for Nelson Mandela to be released from prison became an international anthem for the anti-apartheid movement.\n“Hugh’s global and activist contribution to and participation in the areas of music, theatre, and the arts in general is contained in the minds and memory of millions across six continents,” the family statement read.\nIn October last year, Masekela issued a statement that he had been fighting prostate cancer since 2008 and would have to cancel his professional commitments to focus on his health. He said he started treatment after doctors found a “small ‘speck'” on his bladder, and had surgery in March 2016 after the cancer spread.\nMasekela also said he felt an “imbalance” and had an eye problem after a fall in April in Morocco in which he sprained his shoulder.\nHe said another tumor was then discovered and he had surgery.\n“I’m in a good space, as I battle this stealthy disease, and I urge all men to have regular tests to check your own condition,” his statement said, asking the media for privacy.\nCondolences from fans poured out Tuesday on social media paying tribute to the influential musician’s career.\n“A baobob tree has fallen,” Nathi Mthethwa, South Africa’s minister for arts and culture, wrote on Twitter. “The nation has lost a one of a kind musician . We can safely say Bra Hugh was one of the great architects of Afro-Jazz and he uplifted the soul of our nation through his timeless music.”\nSouth African President Jacob Zuma expressed his condolences, saying Masekela “kept the torch of freedom alive globally, fighting apartheid through his music and mobilizing international support for the struggle for liberation and raising awareness of the evils of apartheid … His contribution to the struggle for liberation will never be forgotten.”\nMasekela inspired generations of musicians in jazz and beyond and collaborated in recent years with South African house music DJ Black Coffee and others. “I have no words,” the DJ said Tuesday on Twitter.\nGET THE HOTTEST STORIES STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX: \nThank you for subscribing!

Fossiles retrouvés dans la grotte Guattari en Italie © AFP / Handout / ITALIAN MINISTRY OF CULTURE / AFP\nCe matin, direction San Felice Circeo, au bord de la Méditerranée. J’ai vérifié : il fait un grand soleil ce matin et une vingtaine de degrés. Qu’allons-nous faire dans cette petite ville bénie des Dieux qui porte le nom même du bonheur ? Nous allons au fond d’une grotte.\nMais pas n’importe quelle grotte : la grotte de Guattari ! Depuis ce week-end, c’est même devenu LA grotte où être ! Le ministre italien de la culture, Dario Franceschini parle même \" d’un des sites les plus importants au monde pour l’histoire de l’humanité\".\nOn vient en effet d’y découvrir d’un coup non pas un, ni même deux ou trois, mais neuf squelettes de Néandertaliens ! Sept hommes, une femme et un petit garçon. Tous âgés de 50 à 68 000 ans ; sauf un qui a été daté de 90 à 100 000 ans.\nL'histoire rocambolesque d'un site exceptionnel\n54 min\nD’abord la grotte a été découverte il y a plus de 80 ans, en 1939, alors qu’on faisait des travaux autour d’un hôtel qui appartenait à un certain Guattari. D’où le nom de grotte Guattari. On y avait découvert à l’époque un crâne complet de Néandertalien.\nCe qui avait suffi à la renommée de ce coin d’Italie : l’hôtel avait été rebaptisé l’Hôtel Néandertal. Puis, plus rien : la grotte a été oubliée, l’hôtel a périclité et il est même aujourd’hui à vendre. Plus rien jusque fin 2019 où une nouvelle fouille est décidée.\nBingo ! Neuf squelettes complets mais en plus, tout pour des dizaines d’années d’études passionnantes : des milliers d’os d’animaux partiellement carbonisés, présentant des traces de découpes. En clair : des Néandertaliens et le restau qui va avec.\nDes Néandertaliens et des (grosses) hyènes\nC’est le plus passionnant de cette histoire. Lorsqu’en 1939, on a trouvé le 1er crâne, on a remarqué qu’il portait un gros trou dans la tempe. Les archéologues de l’époque se sont mis à fantasmer à partir de l’idée que Néandertal était une brute épaisse.\nLeur conclusion ? Cannibalisme : ce crâne avait été évidé et son cerveau mangé comme un ris-de-veau. Sauf que nos archéologues d’aujourd’hui ont trouvé d’autre crânes percés de la même façon dans la grotte et leurs conclusions sont tout à fait différentes.\nCes traces sont typiques de blessures de hyènes. Pas nos petites hyènes d’aujourd’hui, qui sont déjà assez effrayantes. D’énormes hyènes de l’âge de pierre. L’hypothèse est donc que certains de ces neuf individus ont servi de repas à des hyènes.\nUne grotte exceptionnelle qu'on pourrait bientôt visiter\n53 min\nLe ministère italien de la Culture l’espère et demande d’ailleurs l’aide de l’Europe pour mettre en valeur et protéger le site. Il faut savoir que, comme souvent en archéologie, on a eu beaucoup de chance.\nD’une part, ce site a été scellé dès la préhistoire par un éboulement et, d’autre part, son oubli après la découverte de 1939 a préservé son intégrité. Ce qui signifie qu’il peut être aujourd’hui étudié dans les règles de l’art. Alors, on y va au fond de la grotte ?",

CBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was  sentenced to life in federal prison .\nIn a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the kidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child's mother, he drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took the child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her into a room and held her captive.\nIt was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's room. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and hiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers, having visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort Worth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family friend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police Department responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the front passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into the hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry basket.\nThe video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and Webb eventually came out naked.\n\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in custody; we have her.\"\nFollowing a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth deliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping the girl.\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she and her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother knocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\nThe victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and smart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical fight\" for her daughter's life.\n\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for and agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope is that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he will never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox.\nTrending News\nFor Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app iOS Android Fire TV Apple TV Roku All Smart TV Apps",

        "articleBody": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday unveiled the first global geological map of Saturn's moon Titan including vast plains and dunes of frozen organic material and lakes of liquid methane, illuminating an exotic world considered a strong candidate in the search for life beyond Earth.\nThe map was based on radar, infrared and other data collected by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017. Titan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the Solar System's second-biggest moon behind Jupiter 's Ganymede. It is larger than the planet Mercury .\nOrganic materials - carbon-based compounds critical for fostering living organisms - play a leading role on Titan.\n\"Organics are very important for the possibility of life on Titan, which many of us think likely would have evolved in the liquid water ocean under Titan's icy crust,\" said planetary geologist Rosaly Lopes of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\n\"Organic materials can, we think, penetrate down to the liquid water ocean and this can provide nutrients necessary for life, if it evolved there,\" added Lopes, who led the research published in the journal Nature Astronomy .\nThe first global geologic map of Titan. ( NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU )\nOn Earth, water rains down from clouds and fills rivers, lakes and oceans. On Titan, clouds spew hydrocarbons like methane and ethane - which are gases on Earth - in liquid form due to the moon 's frigid climate.\nRainfall occurs everywhere on Titan, but the equatorial regions are drier than the poles, said study co-author Anezina Solomonidou, a European Space Agency research fellow.\nPlains (covering 65 percent of the surface) and dunes (covering 17 percent of the surface) made up of frozen bits of methane and other hydrocarbons dominate Titan's mid-latitudes and equatorial regions, respectively.\nTitan is the only Solar System object other than Earth boasting stable liquids on the surface, with lakes and seas of full of methane being major features at its polar regions. Hilly and mountainous areas, thought to represent exposed portions of Titan's crust of water ice, represent 14 percent of the surface.\n\"What is really fun to think about is if there are any ways that those more complex organics can go down and mix with water in the deep icy crust or deep subsurface ocean,\" JPL scientist and study co-author Michael Malaska said.\nNoting that on Earth there is a bacterium that can survive just on a hydrocarbon called acetylene and water, Malaska asked, \"Could it or something like it live in Titan deep in the crust or ocean where temperatures are a little warmer?\"\nThe map was created seven years before the US space agency is set to launch its Dragonfly mission to dispatch a multi-rotor drone to study Titan's chemistry and suitability for life. Dragonfly is scheduled to reach Titan in 2034.\n\"It is not only scientifically important but also really cool - a drone flying around on Titan,\" Lopes said. \"It will be really exciting.\"\n(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Tom Brown)",

One of Alibaba’s New York-listed shares will be worth eight of its Hong Kong shares.\nThe Chinese company’s decision to float in Hong Kong despite months of often-violent anti-government protests is seen as a vote of confidence from Beijing in the city’s status as a Asian financial hub.\nIt is also regarded as significant to Hong Kong, which lost out on Alibaba’s initial public offering to New York in 2013 as the territory would not then accept the company’s unusual governance structure.\nSmall investors in Hong Kong have welcomed the deal, subscribing for so many shares they will be allotted the maximum 10 per cent of the total they can get, Reuters reported.\nHong Kong’s exchange operates a system where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them getting a greater share of the total offering.\nAlibaba’s listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange next Tuesday.\nMain image credit: Getty",

        "articleBody": "Published Wed, Nov 20 2019 4:29 AM EST Updated Wed, Nov 20 2019 5:37 AM EST\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Dubai's flagship carrier Emirates Airline finalized a deal to purchase 30 of Boeing 's 787-9 Dreamliner jets, executives of both companies announced Wednesday at the Dubai Air Show.\nThe deal sets up for a reduction to a prior commitment of 777x jets from the U.S. plane-maker, down by 30 to 126, which Emirates is opting for by employing its substitution rights. The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines. \nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier . Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline — the largest international carrier in the world — will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production . Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.",

        "articleBody": "A \"phase one\" trade deal between the United States and China was supposed to be a limited agreement that would allow leaders from both countries to claim an easy victory while soothing financial markets.\nBut it may morph into something bigger if US President Donald Trump agrees to Beijing's demands to roll back existing tariffs on Chinese goods, people familiar with the talks say.\nChina's commerce ministry said this month that removing tariffs imposed during the trade war is an important condition to any deal. The demand has US officials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US farm goods, promises of improved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect intellectual property are enough to ask in return.\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to see China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US maintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to campaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to voters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product purchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand dictate deals instead.\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from the 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and consumer goods.\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in annual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he would likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US put in place since the trade war started in 2018.\nTrump and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such concessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a second person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US on any deal, and hasn't committed to any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don't, that's it.\"\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an October news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could now be pushed into next year, trade experts say.",

        "articleBody": "Audi has revealed the second production model in its e-tron all-electric range, with the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback making its debut at the LA Auto Show. Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.\nIt’s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile.\nAt the front, there’s Audi’s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It’s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road – such as markings – with extra-precision.\nFor the rear, there’s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap.\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It’ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper.\nEurope will get the option of Audi’s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations.\nPower and Performance\nIn Europe, there’ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They’ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\nIt’ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to “S” and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It’s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds.\nQuattro is standard, and there’s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select – with seven different drive modes – will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches.\nRange and Charging\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It’s worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\nStill, there’ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\nFor Level 2 stations, there’ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge – which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in – will also be enabled in 2020.\nInterior and Technology\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or “frunk,” you’re looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker’s twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There’ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi’s phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional.\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there’ll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it’ll also be used to control a new “functions on demand” system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis.\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback “edition one”: it’ll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year.",

        "articleBody": "\"Nissan has a vibrant portfolio of new-generation sedans for customers in the U.S. Market. With more than 6 million Sentra vehicles sold, we believe the all-new Sentra will reach new heights offering refinement and quality, technology and performance not seen before. The lower stance and more athletic design cues from the Maxima sports sedan give Sentra a sexy new look,” said David Kershaw, division vice president, Nissan Sales & Regional Operations at Nissan North America Inc.\nTaking on a sleeker appearance, the 2020 Sentra gets a new V-Motion front grill that is complemented by a pair of eye-catching LED headlights. It also has a more sculpted hood which further accentuates the Sentra's sportier design. Wraparound taillights, meanwhile, give the sedan a sophisticated finish and are of the LED kind as well. A blacked roof along with five-spoke alloy wheels provide the 2020 Sentra an unmistakable look.\nInside, the Sentra's interior has been refined and is covered in high quality materials. The seats, the dashboard panel, as well as the steering wheel are all wrapped in fine leather. It also has contrast stitching which spruces up the overall look of the cabin. To improve riding comfort for the driver and front passenger, it has Nissan's NASA-inspired Zero Gravity Seats and come with a heated function.\nIn-car infotainment comes courtesy of an 8-inch touchscreen display. It comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Nissan Connect. It also doubles as a display for the Intelligent Around View Monitor which allows for safer parking / maneuvering.\nAn all-new 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine replaces the previous 1.8-liter from before. It puts out 151 PS along with 197 Nm of torque; which Nissan claims is a 20% and 16% improvement respectively compared to the older engine. Besides having more oomph, Nissan said that the new 2.0-liter will deliver better fuel efficiency.\nA bevy of active and passive safety features are available on the 2020 Sentra. These include 10 airbags, rear door alert, intelligent forward collision warning, as well as intelligent driver awareness. Aside from those, driver assist systems such as automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, and high beam assist are also available on the 2020 Sentra.\nThe all-new sedan is set to go on sale in the US in late January. As to when will this arrive in the Philippines, we're not entirely sure yet. However, since the Sylphy already debuted in China last April 2019, maybe it's only a matter of time before it gets to the ASEAN region. Who knows, maybe its next appearance will be at the 2020 Bangkok International Motor Show which might signal its arrival to the Philippine market some time next year.\nAudi’s second electric vehicle – the E-Tron Sportback – officially debuts 2019-11-20 14:35:08 Jose Altoveros\nThe most powerful Mini hot hatch to come out of Oxford has 306 HP and a huge rear wing 2019-11-20 11:21:10 Marcus De Guzman",

        "articleBody": "The bizarre odyssey of how Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen came to co-write the euphoric power-ballad that Jessie Buckley performs at the end of “ Wild Rose ” — easily the year’s best original movie song — began 10 years ago, when the “Melvin and Howard” star woke up after a minor arm surgery feeling like her mind was on fire.\n“I felt strange as soon as the anesthesia started to wear off,” Steenburgen said. “The best way I can describe it is that it just felt like my brain was only music, and that everything anybody said to me became musical. All of my thoughts became musical. Every street sign became musical. I couldn’t get my mind into any other mode.”\nFun as that might sound in an Oliver Sacks kind of way — the late neurologist wrote about similar, potentially stroke-inspired symptoms in his book “Musicophilia” —  Steenburgen wasn’t thrilled about the sudden mental shift. The next two months were tough. “I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t have acted,” she said. “I couldn’t have learned any lines. My husband [actor Ted Danson] and I were kind of frightened about it.”\nSteenburgen’s son, filmmaker Charlie McDowell (“The Discovery,” “The One I Love”), also remembers it as a trying time. “If your mom comes to you after surgery and says that her head is now full of music, I think it’s totally fair to think that she’s gone crazy and has major psychological problems,” he said. “All of a sudden she was referencing these obscure indie bands and picking up random instruments — I’m not gonna lie, the accordion playing drives me nuts ,” McDowell laughed. “When I say all this out loud it sounds insane. It was definitely a change.”\nDespite the paucity of roles for women in their mid-50s, the actress wasn’t exactly itching to do something else. “I had been somebody who really liked music,” she said, “but I had never been obsessed with it; I was obsessed with acting , and that felt like a big enough subject for me.”\nWhen the music didn’t go away, Steenburgen realized that she had to do something with it — if only for her sanity — even though she didn’t know how to play an instrument. “I called a very talented friend of mine on Martha’s Vineyard and I said: ‘Look, if I come over every day and sing what I hear in my head, could you help me make them into songs?’” she said. She wrote hundreds of songs that summer and sent 12 of the best ones to a music lawyer under her mother’s name. “He wanted to work with ‘Nellie Wall,’ but then I showed up instead,” she said.\nThe next thing she knew, Steenburgen had been signed to Universal as a songwriter and was on a plane to Nashville. It was the first stride on a strange path that would eventually lead to Tom Harper and Jessie Buckley’s doorstep almost a decade later.\nFlash-forward to 2017, when Harper — a young British filmmaker hot off directing a lush BBC adaptation of “War & Peace” — had just found his next project. He’d fallen in love with an electric Nicole Taylor script called “Wild Rose,” a fish-out-of-water story about a self-destructive Glaswegian country singer and single mom whose only dream in life is to sing Patsy Cline ballads at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry. Buckley — who landed a key role in “War & Peace” after surging to fame on the U.K. singing competition “I’d Do Anything” — had agreed to play Rose-Lynn Harlan, and Harper knew in his bones that she was perfect for the part.\nThere was just one problem: The climactic song that ties the whole movie together didn’t exist. The script called for a soaring, original anthem that Rose-Lynn belts to a loving hometown crowd in the very last scene after she’s learned to reconcile her dreams with her reality in a way that makes them both feel a little more special, but no details. Phoning in from London, Harper remembered the anxiety of moving forward without that crucial missing piece: “The script just said something along the lines of, ‘Rose-Lynn sings an incredible song and it conveys everything that she wants to express to her mom and kids and everyone’s uplifted. The end,’” Harper said. “I had faith that we could figure it out, but it was really worrying.” Universal’s music division provided some demos, but none of them clicked.\nAt the last minute, a sample came in called “Glasgow (“No Place Like Home”). “It grabbed me by the heart the moment I heard it,” he said. “It just connected .” Buckley, who phoned in from the Chicago set of “Fargo,” had a similar experience: “It was just that immediate feeling of ‘ this is the song .’”\nThat’s when Harper and Buckley first learned who had written it, and found themselves blindsided by “the Mary Steenburgen of it all.”\nAs it turned out, Steenburgen had spent the last few years toiling away on her own dream of making it in Music City. And despite the many advantages that her fame might have afforded her, she was more nervous about going there than Rose-Lynn Harlan has ever been about anything. “It was terrifying,” she said. “The first session I did was a total disaster, and I literally went back to my hotel room in tears, cried my eyes out, and thought ‘Why would anyone be so stupid at age 54 to think they could do something so new?’”\nBut she also felt like she didn’t have much of a choice. “I was back at it by the next morning,” she said. “I just told myself: ‘I’m going to go right up and sing the bleeping song if it kills me!’” Not long after that, Steenburgen bought a house in Nashville.\nMcDowell still laughs at the memory of hearing his mom spontaneously begin to scat in the backseat of his car. “It could have been really easy for Mary Steenburgen to just put her name on something and get a pass on many of the usual steps in some new creative thing, but she didn’t do that,” she said. “She put in the time to learn the craft, and I respect that. And I have to admit, she’s gotten really good at the accordion.”\nSteenburgen’s career experience also gave her a unique advantage over the competition: While most of the songwriters who submitted demos for “Wild Rose” were content to read a plot synopsis and work in broad strokes from there, Steenburgen approached the assignment as if the song were a character for her to play. “I fought to get the full script, because I just felt like I was looking at such a small part of the story without it,” she said. “Where does Rose-Lynn live? What does her apartment look like? I needed to think of imagery that might be cohesive with what the production designer, the cinematographer, and the composer would be doing; there are all these people you haven’t met yet who are telling the same story. And as soon as I read the whole thing, I understood what we were writing.”\nThat process led to a realization: “It was a really love song from Rose-Lynn to her mother …It was also a love song to her city and a love song to the concept of home and the fact that home doesn’t have to be second best for her or something that she settles for.”\nBoth accomplished songwriters who had previously written music for the television show “Nashville,” Steenburgen’s co-writers Caitlyn Smith and Kate York came to the project with a similar appreciation for the challenge of writing character-driven chords. “It’s a totally different muscle,” York said. “You have to take yourself out of it a little bit — it’s kind of like acting, I guess.” Smith agreed: “It’s a different job altogether. If you’re just writing a song for someone else, it’s wide open and sometimes hard to figure out. And if you’re writing for yourself, you’re really digging into your own heart.” This particular task was a little bit of both. “I feel like we could get into the guts of this song because we’ve all lived a similar crazy dream story,” Smith said.\nThe first thing they found out is that Rose-Lynn worships Patsy Cline, and so the three writers knew they had to craft something with classic country DNA (not an obvious assumption in a film that builds to a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo from a genre-bending superstar like Kacey Musgraves). Smith seized on something with a 6/8 feel, and they all decided to stay there. But the songwriters also reckoned with the role that Glasgow plays in Rose-Lynn’s life, and not just as an albatross around her neck.\n“Anything we wrote had to have a fond hint of Scotland,” Steenburgen said. “So I called one of my best friends, a Scottish woman who started out as a nanny and ended up like a sister,” a detail that dovetails eerily well with the plot of the film. “So I called her up and said ‘Talk to me in your accent — talk to me about you.’ And through that we wound up with images like the opening line: ‘I’ve worn out the stones in front of your doorstep.’”\nThe entire song went from a dream to a demo in just a few short hours — which, when you listen to “Glasgow,” seems as crazy as the story that led Steenburgen to co-write it. “It may sound shallow or like it’s a factory when I talk about how fast we write these things,” Steenburgen said, “but I always think of it like this: ‘I can’t take days to do a scene.’ I can’t say ‘I don’t know what the emotion is for the character, so can you give me until tomorrow?’ I’m always having to tell stories on a time limit.” Steenburgen has only found one drawback to collaborating with Smith and York: “They’re such good singers that people are going to get intimidated by their demos and go, ‘Well I can’t sing like that, so I’m not doing that song.’”\n“Wild Rose”\n1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right\nBuckley, who hadn’t sung in a long time before the production, worried about doing justice to a song like “Glasgow,” especially given that she had no background in country music. “But the story of it really moved me,” she said, “so I sat down with a guitarist in a room and sang it really badly and just tried to attach some emotional feeling to it before we started filming.”\nBy the time Buckley learned who had written the song, she was only half-surprised: “It made sense, because it clearly came from someone with a complex understanding of character — someone who was able to kind of go right to the root of what this woman’s story is about, and managed to write lyrics that exposed the cracks under the surface,” she said.\nWhile Buckley own story feels something like a fairy tale come true, she drew a distinction with her character. “I told her my secrets and she told me hers and we built a different person together,” she said. “‘Glasgow’ is a song of belonging. It’s about stretching yourself to places that you don’t know are within yourself.” For the first time in a long time, Buckley had something to sing about. “This song was such a gift to me,” she said. In turn, it also became her gift to the women who wrote it.\nSteenburgen called Buckley’s performance “stunning,” but seemed changed by the experience in a fundamentally different way than everyone else involved. “Music is in my genes thanks to the women in my family, and I just think I was somehow granted access to it,” she said. “It was so overwhelming for me in the beginning because I didn’t grow up with having that voice in my head, like Kate and Caitlyn did.”\nThe barnstormer of a song that Rose-Lynn performs in the film’s last scene conveys the ache and discovery of her journey from prison to paradise. It begins with Buckley’s voice cresting through an ocean of silence, as Rose-Lynn summons the strength to confront her regrets until they resolve into love. She apologizes to her family, her children, and the entire life she tried to escape: “I pushed you away, put a pin in a map, then I got lost in the storm.”\nA faint lilt begins to hum behind her, peeking through the lyrics like the first ray of sunshine after a squall: It’s an accordion, lighting Rose-Lynn’s way towards a place she never could have imagined before. “Had to find my own way, make my own mistakes, but you know that I had to go,” she sings. “Ain’t no yellow brick road running through Glasgow, but I found one that’s stronger than stone.”\nAnd then Rose-Lynn hits the chorus with the sweet relief of someone who’s tunneled their way to freedom, as Buckley’s voice swells from low to high and back again. She sings on behalf of anyone who’s ever had to learn about themselves the hard way: “Ain’t no place like home,” she and Rose-Lynn sing together, and as the song becomes so big that it envelopes them both, along with all the Glaswegian extras who packed into Celtic Connections for the 12-hour shoot, and everyone in the audience. It’s staggering.\nIt’s also not the happy ending that Rose-Lynn imagined for herself. And yet, happiness often looks different from how you saw it in your head. When Steenburgen’s life took an unexpected detour, it felt like fate (or a weird quirk of anatomy) was forcing her to choose between the dream she’d had since she was just a starry-eyed girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the strange new reality that had ambushed her in a hospital one night. To hear it from her now, it sounds like she’s found a beautiful harmony between the two.\n“I didn’t fall out of love with acting when this happened,” Steenburgen said, “and I still haven’t. But there’s so much more capability in our brains than we probably realize, and agreeing to diminishment and shutting down doors is a choice that we all make for ourselves. It turns out you don’t really have to do that.”\n“Wild Rose” is now available on DVD and VOD.",

The state’s new slogan for an anti-drug campaign drew a South Dakota-sized share of attention on social media Monday.\nJust what is this priceless slogan?\n“Meth. We’re on it.”\nYes, that’s it. No joke. The governor of South Dakota would like us to know that her state is on meth. You know, like solving the problem. On it !\nOf course, you might just be able to see the issue here, besides the fact that Florida Man will have to up the ante next time.\nAnd if you haven’t yet noticed what might be wrong, a whole lot of people on Twitter pointed it out.\nYes this is real and yes the state spent nearly half a million dollars on it: https://t.co/Nc0nKoXGBP — Dianna E. Anderson 🏳️‍🌈 (@diannaeanderson) November 18, 2019\nSo many people were talking about South Dakota’s odd new slogan that the state and “We’re On It\" became top Twitter trends.\nAccording to a report in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, Gov. Kristi Noem launched the campaign on Monday in an effort to address the state’s meth crisis.\n“Meth. We’re on it” is rolling out with TV commercials and billboards in which people say, “I’m on meth.”\nThe report says the Minneapolis ad agency Broadhead Co. came up with the campaign, and the state has paid the agency nearly $449,000 so far this year.\nOh, no. It seems like the rest of South Dakota's anti-drug campaigns are just as bad as the \"Meth.

There isn’t a single solution because meth is widespread. But we can approach it from different angles, so it doesn’t take over counties, towns, neighborhoods. Let’s work together. Meth. We’re on it.”\nHey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness.

V네크라인은 얼굴이 둥근 신부, 하이 네크라인은 얼굴이 길거나 목이 긴 신부에게 잘 어울린다. 어떤 네크라인의 드레스를 입는지에 따라 고객의 단점이 장점으로, 혹은 장점이 단점으로 될 수 있기에 가장 중점적으로 보는 것 중 하나이다. _ 최재훈컴퍼니 남지영 이사\n신부가 원하는 이미지를 찾아내 그에 맞춰 추천한다 얼굴, 체형, 분위기 모두 중요하지만 무엇보다 신부가 되고 싶어하는 이미지를 찾아주는 ‘이미지 메이킹’에 중점을 두고 드레스를 제안한다. 어떤 이미지의 신부가 되고 싶은지 고객의 의견을 듣고 골라주는 것이다. 엘레강스, 큐트, 도회적, 클래식 등 전체적인 이미지 콘셉트를 먼저 잡고 디자인을 선택한다. 사실 거의 신부와의 첫 대면에서 어떤 이미지가 어울리는지 그림이 그려지긴 하지만 신부에게 먼저 추천하진 않는다. 평생 한번 입는 웨딩드레스이기에 단지 외적으로 예쁜 것 이상의 의미가 있다고 생각하기 때문. 우선 신부 본인이 꿈꾸던 디자인이나 스타일을 먼저 들어보고 가급적 같이 고른다. 본인이 평상시 꿈꾸던 신부의 모습과 실제 어울리는 스타일을 고객과 전문가가 맞춰가는 과정이 있어야 자신에게 완벽히 어울리는 드레스를 고를 수 있다. _ 클라라웨딩 박순옥 원장\n스타일에 대해 조언할 뿐, 강요하지 않는다 모든 신부는 웨딩드레스를 고르기 위해 숍을 방문할 때 드레스에 대한 부푼 꿈과 로망을 안고 온다. 본인이 원하는 스타일을 어느 정도 준비해서 오는 경우가 많다. 그래서 전문가의 눈으로 봤을 때 가장 적합한 드레스를 추천한다 해도, 고객의 마음에 들지 않으면 아무 의미가 없기 때문에, 고객의 취향 파악을 가장 우선시한다. 웨딩드레스는 개인의 취향이 선택에 큰 영향을 미치므로 스타일을 가이드할 뿐 강요하지는 않는 것. 먼저 고객의 니즈와 기본 데이터를 파악한 후 전문가의 시선으로 계절감과 식장 분위기에 맞는 소재, 스타일, 색상을 선별해 고객에게 잘 어울릴 만한 디자인을 다양하게 추천한다. _ 몽유애 황주영 이사\n1 죠슈아벨브라이덜 2 브라이드메르시 3 발레리아스포사\n단점보다 장점을 찾아 예쁜모습을 극대화한다 보통 신부들의 경우 자신의 단점을 무조건 가리고 싶어 한다. 예를 들어 어깨가 넓다거나 팔뚝이 굵은 것이 콤플렉스인 신부들은 이 부위를 가리고 싶어 획일화된 디자인의 드레스를 원하는 경향이 있는데, 그럴 경우 오히려 억지로 가린 부분이 더 부각될 뿐 아니라 피해야 할 디자인에 국한되어 드레스 선택의 폭이 좁아져버린다. 억지로 가리기보다 그냥 자신있게 드러내고 그 위에 베일이나 오프숄더 장식으로 연출하는 것이 오히려 단점을 커버할 수 있는 스타일이라는 것을 제안한다. 살이 찐 신부들은 본인의 뚱뚱한 체형을 풍성한 벨라인으로 가리고자 고집하는데, 체구가 더 커 보일 수 있으니 A라인이나 세미 머메이드라인을 추천한다. 상체에서 허리 아래로 떨어지는 라인 덕분에 키가 커 보이고 슬림해 보이기 때문이다. _ 디아뜨르 김진희 디자이너\nAdvice 웨딩드레스를 선택할 때 이런 실수는 피하자! 1 드레스는 무조건 화려해야 한다는 편견을 버리자. 원하는 스타일을 미리 확인하는 것도 고객의 취향을 파악하는 데 큰 도움이 되기는 하나, 사진으로 보는 것과 본인이 직접 입었을 때의 느낌은 정말 많이 다르다. 중요한 건 본인의 이미지와 체형 그리고 예식 콘셉트에 맞는 디자인을 선택하는 것 이다.\n2 웨딩드레스숍은 웨딩홀이 아니다. 매장에서도 조명을 비롯한 각종 인테리어로 웨딩드레스가 예쁘게 보일 수 있도록 하고 있지만, 실제로 식을 올리는 웨딩홀과는 전체적인 분위기가 다를 수 밖에 없다. ‘나무만 보지 말고 숲을 보라’는 말처럼 웨딩드레스도 겉으로 드러나는 모습은 전체적인 라인과 소재감이니 꼭 염두에 둘 것.",

Ngoài những gương mặt quen thuộc như Quang Hải, Hùng Dũng, Tuấn Anh, Xuân Trường..., chiến lược gia người Hàn Quốc đã triệu tập nhiều tuyển thủ tưởng như không có cơ hội lên ĐTQG như Tấn Trường, Văn Quyết, Minh Tùng hay Sầm Ngọc Đức....\n\"Về cơ bản, HLV Park vẫn lựa chọn những con người quen thuộc với triết lý bóng đá của ông. Tuy nhiên lần này HLV Park đã trao lại cơ hội cho những cầu thủ dày dạn kinh nghiệm ở ĐTQG như Tấn Trường hay Văn Quyết. Khả năng năng, ngoài sự ghi nhận những nỗ lực của các lão tướng, HLV Park đang muốn làm mới lối chơi của đội tuyển Việt Nam để các đối thủ khó bắt bài\", chuyên gia Nguyễn Thành Vinh nhận định.\nTrong khi đó, BLV Vũ Quang Huy đánh giá, HLV Park từng triệu tập những lão tướng như Anh Đức và ông cho thấy sự đúng đắn khi Anh Đức góp công lớn giúp đội tuyển Việt Nam vô địch AFF Cup 2018. BLV Quang Huy nói: \"Rõ ràng HLV Park cho thấy sự cầu thị và khẳng định mọi cầu thủ dù lớn tuổi hay không, cứ đá tốt thì sẽ có cơ hội lên đội tuyển.\nTấn Trường hay Văn Quyết có lẽ từng nghĩ mình hết thời hoặc bị HLV Park bỏ rơi, nhưng trên thực tế họ vẫn được triệu tập vì phong độ tốt. Trong quá khứ, HLV Park từng triệu tập lão tướng Anh Đức và cầu thủ này rất thành công trên đội tuyển\".\nViệc triệu tập những cựu binh như Văn Quyết sẽ giúp HLV Park Hang Seo có cơ hội làm mới ĐTQG. Ảnh: Hoàng Linh\nBên cạnh đó, BLV Quang Huy cho rằng, những Văn Quyết, Tấn Trường, Minh Tùng hay Ngọc Đức sẽ giúp HLV Park có thêm nhiều lựa chọn nhân sự chất lượng:\n\"Văn Quyết từng là đội trưởng đội tuyển Việt Nam thi đấu AFF Cup 2018 dưới thời HLV Park, nhưng sau đó cầu thủ này không được triệu tập. Dẫu vậy, Văn Quyết đã có tên trong lần triệu tập tới đây.\nCó thể Văn Quyết đã có sự tiến bộ và HLV Park muốn tìm sự thay đổi lối chơi của đội tuyển Việt Nam trong thời gian tới. Văn Quyết đá sơ đồ 4-2-3-1 hay 4-1-4-1 thì sẽ rất tốt, chứ đá 4-3-3 thì Quyết chưa phù hợp vì cần cầu thủ tuyến trên trên mạnh mẽ và có thể hỗ trợ tốt khâu phòng ngự. Có thể việc gọi Văn Quyết thì HLV Park sẽ hé lộ thêm sơ đồ chiến thuật mới.\nNgoài ra cũng phải kể đến Trọng Hoàng, tưởng rằng Trọng Hoàng đã qua thời kỳ đỉnh cao nhưng khi được HLV Park trao cơ hội, anh lại thể hiện phong độ xuất sắc tại AFF Cup 2018. Còn trường hợp của Tấn Trường rất thú vị.\nAi cũng nghĩ Tấn Trường về với Hà Nội sẽ dự bị cho Văn Công nhưng thực tế, Tấn Trường chơi rất hay và chiếm suất bắt chính của Văn Công. Vì vậy, HLV Park trao cơ hội lên đội tuyển là điều tất yếu.\nMinh Tùng đá hậu vệ trái và trung vệ. Minh Tùng có tố chất đa năng ở hàng phòng ngự. Cầu thủ này từng triệu tập lên ĐTQG dưới thời HLV Miura. Minh Tùng có thể hình tốt và chơi khá hay trong màu áo Thanh Hóa ở mùa giải vừa qua.\nChính vì vậy, Minh Tùng góp mặt trên ĐTQG là hoàn toàn xứng đáng. Ở đợt tập trung này, HLV Park cũng đang có sự ưu ái nhất định cho những cầu thủ có thể hình tốt như Minh Tùng.",

Help! \nThe simple answer is that foods with low acidity need to be canned in a pressure canner. For this jam, though, all you need is an inexpensive water bath canner with a rack. A water bath canner is really just a big porcelain stockpot that will hold about ten canning jars depending on their size. They also come with a rack that makes removing your jars easier and keeps them from coming in contact with the bottom of the canner. \nIn addition to the canner pot, you will need some mason jars (I prefer 8-ounce jelly jars ), a ladle, and something to remove the hot jars from boiling water. You could get creative or just use a jar lifter which is a nifty set of tongs made specifically to fit over mason jars. \nMAKING SPICED HONEY PEAR JAM\nNow that you have your equipment, you will need the ingredients. About 8 ripe pears, a fresh lemon, fruit pectin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves, and a 16-ounce  Don Victor® Orange Blossom Comb Honey Globe Jar . Before getting your jam mixture ready, fill your canner to the line on the inside and set it to simmer. Add your jelly jars and let them get warm while you make your jam. \nCube and peel the pears with a paring knife and put them in a large pot. To the pears, add the juice of one lemon and spices. Stir together and taste test it to make sure your flavors are where you want them to be before adding the fruit pectin powder. Heat to boiling for a minute or so to combine the spices and pears, then add a jar Don Victor® Honey, or about a cup and a half. Let the mixture boil until thickened on the back of a spoon, or about 5-8 minutes. \nHOW TO USE A WATER BATH CANNER\nWhen your jam mixture is the correct consistency, use a ladle to transfer the mixture into the warm and sterilized jelly jars. I may or may not have been going a little too fast and spilled some hot jam on my hand. I don’t recommend that, so please pour slowly and carefully. \nNow that your jars are filled, put the tops on, lower the rack into the canner, and use your jar lifter to lower the jars into the water one at a time. Turn the stove up from simmering to boil the jars for *10 minutes. If you live at an altitude of more than 1000 feet as I do, you will need to adjust your boiling time. There are altitude charts available online. We are at 5280 feet in Denver so I boiled mine for 20 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the boiling water and let them cool for several hours. If your jam looks runny, don’t worry. It will thicken as it cools. It could take 24-48 hours to really look like jam. \nGIVING THE GIFT OF HOMEMADE JAM\nIf you choose to gift your honey pear jam to friends and family, there are so many ways you can present your gift. Make cute labels, put it in a gift basket, or add a piece of fabric and a ribbon to dress up the jar and pass them out to your friends and family. No matter how you choose to present your gift, it’s sure to be a winner. \nDecorating the top of your jelly jars with fabric is super simple. Cut a piece of fabric in a circle to use as a cover for your jelly jars and fasten with a ribbon to make them extra festive. Set them aside in a pretty basket if you wish, ready to hand out to your friends, family, and coworkers. \nUSING HONEY INSTEAD OF SUGAR\nI like to use honey because it has more flavor than sugar. In general, when substituting honey for sugar in a recipe you will use about half the amount. For instance, the original recipe for this jam called for three cups of sugar, but I only use a cup and a half of honey. \nBoth the pear jam and honey are a delicious addition to toast, biscuits, or homemade vanilla scones. \n8-9 ripe pears, cored and peeled 1 lemon, or about 1/4 cup lemon juice 6 tbsp fruit pectin powder 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp nutmeg 1 tsp ground ginger 1/2 tsp ground cloves 1 jar Don Victor® Honey, or 1 1/2 cups\nInstructions Fill canner with water and set it to simmer. Add empty jelly jars to sterilize and warm. Core, peel, and cube the pears and put them in a pot. Add the juice of one lemon, spices, and fruit pectin. Boil while stirring frequently for about a minute Add 1 1/2 cups Don Victor® Honey and boil until thickened enough to stick to the spoon. Spoon jam mixture into jelly jars, put the top on, and put them in a water bath canner, increasing the heat to a easy boil. Boil for *10 minutes (if over 1000 feet, adjust for altitude) Remove from canner and allow to cool. Jam will set within 24-48 hours.",

        "articleBody": "Washington, DC, United States –  Getting to the moon, while not easy, has been done. Staying on the moon and reaching Mars, however, haven not. Why? Because space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\nIt is for that reason that the United States ‘s space agency NASA on Monday enlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space industry’s upstarts – Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s  Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX among them – to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon shot.\n“We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had enhanced lander capabilities,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference call with media.\n“This is based on our objectives, the agency’s objectives, to get to the moon as soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human exploration standpoint,” he said.\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for contracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments, and to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed to that timeline.\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA’s Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted “technical challenges, cost increases and schedule delays “. The report and Monday’s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency’s 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\nIn May, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expand ed to Jupiter’s moon Europa, as NASA’s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moon’s icy crust.\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life – chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water – are on Europa.\nCloser to home, NASA’s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth’s moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions – Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX – are notable for not having been on last year’s original list.\n“We’re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. “It’s very exciting times. We’re using our Blue moon lander, which is [a] big one.”\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics Inc and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery – indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n“Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,” said Michael Sims, CEO and founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n“There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players. And we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity that adds to the mix.”",

        "articleBody": "Samsung Biologics , Samsung Group’s biotechnology unit, revealed that it had formed a partnership with  Moderna Inc. , a biotech company focused on mRNA technology development. Under the agreement, Samsung Biologics would offer its fully integrated manufacturing technologies and services to produce Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273.\nAccording to the South Korean drug manufacturer, the large-scale manufacturing deal would mainly involve the fill-finish process. Fill-finish is the procedure wherein manufacturers fill vials with vaccines, complete the packaging stage, and prepare the products for distribution.\nAfter finalizing the deal, the two companies would immediately begin the technology transfer at Samsung Biologics’ complex in Incheon. Furthermore, the company would utilize its cutting-edge production line to deliver aseptic fill-finish, labeling, and packaging services. Following the production of hundreds of millions of mRNA-1273 doses, Samsung Biologics would aid the supplies’ distribution to markets outside the US.\nCommitment to Fighting the Pandemic\n“This vaccine is paramount to people around the world in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,” said John Rim, CEO of Samsung Biologics. “We truly appreciate our client, Moderna, for entrusting and choosing to partner with Samsung Biologics for the fill and finish of this important vaccine.”\nRim also added that the company has already laid down tight schedules and action plans for the mRNA-1273 production. Due to the world population’s high vaccine urgency levels, Samsung Biologics aims to distribute the supplies during 2021’s second half commercially.\nSimilarly, Moderna’s Chief Technical Operations and Quality Officer, Juan Andres, shared that Samsung Biologics considerably boosts its global production capacity. Andres also said that Moderna and its manufacturing partners’ commitment to fighting the pandemic remains solid.\nMFDS Gives the Go-Ahead\nMeanwhile, in South Korea, the  Ministry of Food and Drug Safety  (MFDS) finally approved the Moderna vaccine usage. This move welcomed the country’s fourth COVID-19 vaccine. Previously, MFDS gave the green light to vaccines from AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer. The South Korean panel conducted trials and evaluated the Moderna vaccine efficacy on over 28,000 participants.\nMoreover, the data indicated that the mRNA-1237 94.1% efficacy rate in protecting people against the virus. In addition to the Samsung Biologics partnership, the current administration collaborated with Moderna, bringing in vaccines for 20 million individuals. After confirming the agreement with Moderna, Samsung Biologics’ shares increased by up to 5.2%.",

        "articleBody": "ヘッドホンなどをはじめ幅広いジャンルで活躍するAVライター。ハイレゾ音源についても造詣が深く、アニソンレーベルのスーパーバイザーを務めるほか、TBSテレビ開運音楽堂「KAIUNハイレゾ」コーナーではアドバイザーとしてレギュラー出演している。\n再生機器＆配信、それぞれ広がりつつある「MQA」を取り巻く状況\n野村 　前回も言ったように、MQAをハイレゾ音源として聴くためには、対応する機材をそろえなければいけませんが、実はそのままでも音楽CD相当の音源として聴けちゃいます。そこがMQAの面白いところなんです。現在e-onkyo musicで販売されているMQAコーデックのファイルは、再生するプレーヤーのソフトウェア的には、48kHz/24bitの「FLAC」形式として認識されるので、実はFLACが再生できる環境であれば、そのまま再生できるというわけなんです。ただもちろん、この場合、音質はあくまでも音楽CDクラス。よりいい音のハイレゾ音源としてMQAファイルを聴く場合には、対応する再生ソフトウェアなり、ハードウェアを用意する必要があるというわけです。\n鎌田 　なるほど。一般のハイレゾ対応プレーヤーなどでも、CD音源レベルのFLACとしては再生可能ということですね。では、ハイレゾ音源としてのMQA対応プレーヤーの状況は、今どんな感じなんでしょうか？\n野村 　まだまだ対応するハードウェアは少なくて、パソコン向けのUSB-DAC製品では、今現在（2017年9月時点）では、MQAを開発した英国のMERIDIANやMYTEKが販売している製品がメインですね。ただ、MQAというコーデックは、それほど特殊なものではないし、プレーヤー側がMQAに対応するかどうかは純粋にライセンシーだけの問題なので、ソフトウェアアップデートなどでも対応できるはずです。なので、今後、対応製品は増えていくと思います。 いっぽうで、現在のハイレゾ再生はどちらかといえば、パソコンよりも携帯用のデジタルオーディオプレーヤー（DAP）が中心になってきています。DAPという観点で、MQAの再生環境を見てみると、日本でMQAを推進している「e-onkyo music」を運営しているのがオンキヨー＆パイオニアイノベーションズということもあり、「ONKYO」ブランドと「パイオニア」ブランドで発売されているすべてのポータブルプレーヤーおよびスマートフォンが、現在MQA再生に対応しています。具体的には、ONKYO「DP-X1」と「DP-S1」、パイオニアの「XDP-100R」「XDP-300R」と「XDP-30R」、これにONYKOハイレゾスマホの「GRANBEAT DP-CMX1」の計6モデルが、MQA対応のDAP製品ということになります。\n鎌田 　これらに加えて、先日発表されたソニーの「ウォークマン」もMQA対応をうたいました。これはMQAにとっては大きなニュースでしたね。\n野村 　そうですね。10月7日から発売されたハイレゾ対応ウォークマンの新モデル「NW-ZX300」および「A40」シリーズの4モデル（NW-A47、NW-A46HN、NW-A45HN、NW-A45）が、正式にMQAに対応しました。現行モデルの「WM1」シリーズも、ソフトウェアアップデートでMQAに対応する予定ということなので、現行のハイレゾ対応ウォークマンの全モデルが、この秋、MQAに対応したことになります。このようにMQAの再生環境はどんどん裾野が広がってきています。\nこの日用意したMQA対応デバイス。上はMERIDIAN AUDIOの「プライム・ヘッドホン・プリアンプ」（左上）と、「Explorer2」（中央上）。下段は左から、ウォークマン「NW-A40」、「NW-ZX300」（ソニー）、「GRANBEAT」（ONKYO）、「XDP-30R」（パイオニア）、「DP-S1」（ONKYO）\n鎌田 　やはり、ソニー「ウォークマン」というメジャーシリーズがMQAに対応したのは大きいですね。大手のソニーが動いたことで、他メーカーにもこの動きは波及していきそうですよね。\n野村 　はい。今はまだ対応していない、中国メーカー、韓国メーカー製のDAP製品も、今後徐々にMQAに対応していくんじゃないかと思います。こういう動きは、ちょっと方向性は違いますが、同じハイレゾ音源である「DSD」の対応状況と似ている部分もあるかもしれません。DSDが出てきた当初は、ハイレゾ音源の主流である「FLAC」とか「WAV」などのリニアPCM音源に対して、DSDはやや特殊なフォーマットという印象があったように思います。でも、各メーカーがやっぱり対応したほうがいいだろうと考え出した結果、今やDSD再生に対応するプレーヤーはかなり一般的になりました。MQAも同様に、そろそろ対応しておいたほうがいいだろうと考えるメーカーが増えてきていますので、今後、対応状況は広がっていくと思います。あと、レーベル側でも、ワーナーミュージックが毎週300タイトルもMQA形式の配信をスタートするなど、新たな動きが出てきていますので、今後MQAが一気に広がる可能性が出てきました。。\n鎌田 　ところで、ここにいくつかのMQA対応プレーヤーがありますが、野村さんから見て、これからMQAを楽しみたいと思っている方に、おすすめの製品はどのあたりでしょうか？\n野村 　とっかかりやすいのは、ONKYO「DP-S1」とか、ソニー「A40」シリーズあたりの小型プレーヤーでしょうね。価格も手ごろだし、MQAを含むハイレゾ入門にはピッタリかと思います。で、ここでも、MQAのファイルサイズの小ささというのはメリットになると思うんです。このクラスのエントリー製品の場合、内蔵メモリーの容量は16GBのものが多いので、ハイレゾ音源のファイルを入れていくと、それなりにメモリー容量が気になってくると思います。その点、FLACなどに比べて約1/3のファイルサイズで済むMQAは、より多くのファイルを保存できるというのがメリットになってきます。\n鎌田 　メモリー容量の小さなエントリー向けのプレーヤーを購入することが多いライトユーザーのほうが、ファイルサイズが小さなMQAのメリットを享受しやすいというわけですね。いっぽうで、こうしたエントリー機の音質的な面はどうでしょう？\n野村 　たとえば、ONKYOの「DP-X1A」とか、その姉妹機のパイオニア「XDP-100R」「XDP-300R」あたりの上級機の場合、組み合わせるイヤホンなどによっては、ここでは「フルハイレゾ」と呼ばせていただきましょう、FLACやWAVなどと、MQAとの音質的な違いは多少なり感じ取れるとは思います。あくまでも、じっくり比較試聴すれば、ですが。それに対して、ONKYO「DP-S1」やソニー「A40」シリーズあたりのエントリー機となると、上級モデルほど音質の差が顕著に感じられない可能性が高い。ことDAPでのリスニングに絞っていえば、フルハイレゾのFLACやWAVと、その1/3くらいのファイルサイズで済むMQAとの間でそれほど音質差を感じない、ということは、MQAの有用性を裏付けすることになるのではないでしょうか。平たくいえば、DAP試聴メインだったらFLACを選ぶもMQAを選ぶも好み次第使い方次第、といったところでしょうか。\n鎌田 　なるほど。いっぽうで、パソコンと接続するタイプの「USB-DAC」製品ですが、まだ対応デバイスは少ないかと思います。こちらは、ややハードルが高そうですね。\n野村 　今、MQAに限らず、イレゾ音源を楽しむ環境は、パソコンからDAPあるいはスマートフォンにほぼ移ってきているので、基本的に、新規のデバイス開発はモバイルデバイスが中心になっています。最近じゃ、そもそもヘッドホンアンプ製品もなかなか新製品が出てきませんしね。MQAに対応するために、チップやソフトウェアをアップデートするのにもコストがかかるでしょうから、こちらの対応はもう少し時間がかかるかもしれません。据え置き型のハードでは、どちらかというと、ほぼ毎年新モデルが出ているネットワークプレーヤーとかブルーレイレコーダーなんかのほうが、意外に早くMQAに対応するかもしれません。\n鎌田 　ということは、やはりMQAを楽しむなら、やはりこうした小型の専用プレーヤーがメインということになりそうですね。\n野村 　そうですね。あとひとつ注目しているのは「MQA-CD」ですね。MQA-CDは、普通のCDプレーヤーで再生すると音楽CDとして聴けますが、CDプレーヤーなどからの光・同軸デジタル出力をMQA対応のDACなどに接続すれば、MQAのハイレゾサウンドを楽しめるようになります。本格的な普及はこれからですが、すでに発売されているMQA-CDは２種類です。ひとつはMQA方式でデコードされているCD規格のディスク。さらにMQA-CDとSACDとの２層ディスクも「2L」レーベルから発売されました。エンコードがMQAというだけで規格自体は、CDそのもので下位互換性が確保されてます。とてもシンプルで面白い提案だと思います。リッピングも可能でMQA対応USB DACでも再生ができます。\n鎌田 　ちなみに、MQAのサウンドを楽しむには、どんなヘッドホンを買ったらいいとかありますか？　やっぱり「ハイレゾ対応」製品ですか？\n野村 　そうですね。やはり、ONKYO「DP-X1A」とか、パイオニア「XDP-100R」「XDP-300R」くらいのクラスになってくると、（MP3やAACなどの圧縮音源に対して）MQAの音の良質さを明らかに感じるようになるでしょうね。とは言っても、その違いというのは、結構さりげないものだったりするわけで、いつもMQAのハイレゾ音源を聴いていて、たまに圧縮音源を聴いたりすると、「なんだ、これ？」って違和感を感じるっていうようなものです。結局、音の違いって、いい音で聴いたほうがやっぱり楽しいし、聴きやすいわけじゃないですか。そういう意味では、MQAも、中域については明らかにハイレゾの24bitのデータだな、っていう音をしてますから。中域って一番重要なところで、ボーカルとかバイオリンなんかの弦楽器の音が、16bitと24bitでははっきり違うのがわかりますから、そういう意味でも、MQAって結構いいと思いますよ。\n「MQA」と「FLAC」とで、音の違いはどれだけあるのか？　実際に試聴\n野村 　では、TVアニメ「ID-0」のオープニングテーマ、佐咲紗花さんの「ID-0」あたりで聴き比べてみましょうか。FLACとMQAの2つのバージョンを用意したので、聴き比べてその違いを感じてもらえればと思います。フルハイレゾのFLACとMQAとで、音の違いが少なければ、それだけMQAのサウンドがフルハイレゾと遜色ない音ということになりますから。\n鎌田 　そうですね。やっぱり多少は違いますけど、どちらも十分にハイレゾですね。音の広がりも解像感も十分に高くて、迫力があります。ただ、FLACに比べると、MQAのほうがよりボーカルが明瞭というか、ボーカルの下の音のほうが広がっている印象を感じました。\n野村 　そうなんです。MQAは中域にギュッと凝縮するような感じがあるので、そのように感じられるんだと思います。FLACなどのフルハイレゾのほうが、全体域のデータ量が多いわけですが、相対的にMQAのほうが、ボーカルやメイン楽器などが一歩前に出てきたかのような、クリアな聴こえ方をしているように感じると思います。\n鎌田 　どちらもいい音なんだけど、MQAのほうが歌のインパクトは強いかも、ですね。\n野村 　MQAはユニークな音の折り紙という手法でちゃんと24bitの情報量を確保していますし、中高域だけでなく低域も明瞭なため、しっかりハイレゾしてますよね。音の立ち上がりを曖昧にしてしまうエコーノイズをカットしているので、人によっては、むしろクリアに感じられるかもしれない。こういう特徴があるので、MQAは屋外なんかで聴くと、むしろ聴きやすい音に感じられます。声や楽器の音にフォーカスが合って、パッとわかりやすくて聴きやすい音なので、たとえば電車の中で音楽を聴いたりする場合も、ボリュームを下げても聴きやすいと思います。MQAには、実はそういうメリットもあるんですよ。\n※次回、第3回の対談では、ゲストにアニソンアーティストの佐咲紗花さんをお招きし、MQAサウンドについて野村ケンジさんと語っていただきます。ご期待ください！\n「MQA」は英国のMERIDIAN　AUDIO社によって開発された、革新的なハイレゾ音声符号化技術です。\nスタジオマスターと同じクオリティを再現しながら、CD並の転送レートにファイルサイズを小さくできるのが特長。ダウンロードも短時間で行えるなど利便性と高音質化を両立させたハイレゾ技術として世界の音楽業界で注目を集めています。\n日本国内では、オンキヨー＆パイオニアイノベーションズ株式会社が運営する音楽配信サイト「e-onkyo music」にて、2016年4月よりMQAによる音源配信がスタートしており、今後も、配信タイトルは増加する予定となっています。",

Blow told Eurogamer that there are no plans currently to port the 2016 game to Switch, but he has a never say never attitude about it. If it were to happen, Blow would likely outsource the project to a different studio because his team is too busy.\n\"I wouldn't say never,\" Blow said about the possibility of The Witness coming to Nintendo Switch. \"But we worked on that game for a long time. We could have done more ports but I felt like it was a good idea to give the team a break and work on some new things.\"\nClick To Unmute\nWant us to remember this setting for all your devices?\nSign up or Sign in now!\nPlease use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\nThis video has an invalid file format.\nSorry, but you can't access this content!\nPlease enter your date of birth to view this video\nBy clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\nNow Playing: Nintendo Switch Unlikely To Get Acclaimed Puzzle Game The Witness - GS News Update\n\"We're working on new projects now. We're not really working on ports of The Witness but that could change,\" he said. \"Something could happen. We could outsource it and quality control in-house. But we're not currently doing anything.\"\nThe Witness was originally released in January 2016 for PS4 and PC, before coming to Xbox One later that year. An iOS edition was released in 2017.\nThe Switch is selling really well, so there may come a time when the installed base of the hybrid console is too big to ignore, but it seems it's not at that point yet.\nBlow's current project is a game codenamed Sokoban. It's still early days, but Blow sums it up thusly, \"It's weird. It's a level-based game. There's a lot of levels. We have a lot more levels than we had last year.\"\nBlow is one of two programmers on the game, while five artists are also on the team. In addition to that work, Blow is apparently creating a new programming language for it, which may explain why it's taking some time. You can watch Blow's presentation from Gamelab in the video embedded above to learn more about Sokoban.",

It showcased traditional drum performances of the ladies back in the days with mixes of modernized dance moves and music. The theater was fairly small so getting the cheapest tickets would still be ok. Actors occasionally come out from aisles as well… we got seats on the 3rd row, letting us clearly see the facial expressions of everyone stage.

        "articleBody": "轉眼已經12月中，已經釋出了超過一半的新卡片情報，在這裡我想為大家作主題式的介紹，這次的主題是「標準轉生」系列，將會介紹一系列與「標準卡」角色或能力相關的卡片。\n一、同角色不同卡面，調整能力重回戰場\n原版標準卡傳說「 聖女貞德 」的體質是8/5/5，進場送掃場跟自家全體強化，作為一張8費卡片而言掃場效果差強人意，自家強化效果也是一般般，而這次時空轉生的「希望引導者‧聖女貞德」透過將原始體質調整為3/2/3，然後把掃場效果做成7費爆能強化的方式達成雙曲線的彈性效果，不僅3費就可以登場，3/2/3的體質在前期交換戰鬥上也還算是有利(對於1/2與2/2的交換能力都不錯)，7費掃場3點的效果甚至比原版的清除能力更好；至於比原版差的部分，原版的自家buff是+0/+2，新版則是恢復3點生命值，+0/+2是一定會增加2點，而恢復3點則需要先受傷再回復，這方面的效果稍差一點，但本來自家buff就不是那麼重要（比較重要的是掃場），因此這個改動也還算可以接受啦。\n2.先導者妖精公主．阿麗雅：輕量化之二，直接送你0費卡片打連擊\n原本標準卡傳說－「 妖精公主 」算是偏笨重而且效果不是那麼即時的卡片，雖然有與 玫瑰皇后 的優良combo，但精靈本來就不是很缺補充妖精的手段，完全可以不用這麼沉重的卡片來增加妖精到手牌中；時空轉生後的「先導者妖精公主．阿麗雅」則改變成進場、進化各送你一張0/1/1，這個0/1/1在combo效果發動時還會自己消失節省台面空間，需要鋪場時可以提前下(順便觸發後續從者的combo效果)，需要甲蟲一回殺的時後也可以晚一點出讓他自己消失不要卡場，算是很靈活的傳說；而9費的爆能強化某程度上算是可有可無，以致敬原始卡片的觀點而言也許是必須的吧(笑)，但以卡片強度而言，這個9費效果除了手牌枯竭時top抽到可以提供大量資源以外，平常單純想當combo要素使用時則可能會造成卡手的問題，算是一個具有負面性質的爆能效果(因此在論壇間也笑稱這是「爆能弱化」)。\n3.龍之炎．吉爾尼特拉：場面戰鬥力、反場能力強大，有望成為吉將軍\n原本標準卡傳說－「 吉爾尼特拉 」是以往的中速龍／疾馳龍／成長龍會考慮的配件，但大多因為其生效緩慢(召喚的5/5當回合不會動，又要額外吃1個EP)而選擇捨棄這張操作感笨重的卡片，但在時空轉生的「龍之炎．吉爾尼特拉」這個版本中，叫進場的龍是4/3突進的地獄火魔龍，又因為龍之炎．吉爾尼特拉本身的效果，實際上是4/4突進，進化時更是直接變成2張4/4突進。這個鋪場直接生一堆突進的效果令人想到「 魔將•赫克托 」，而「龍之炎．吉爾尼特拉」的優點在於叫出來的生物比較大，交換之後更容易存活，缺點則是本體只有2/3的大小，也不像「魔將•赫克托」可以灌場攻，主要是一張反擊用的卡片，本身的終結能力不是很強。不過至少從原本優勢牌變成劣勢也可以使用的卡片，只要能動、攻擊力夠高，就可以用，是一個相當實用的重製。\n我說CY你不要覺得這樣沒誠意的重製就可以唬過我們這些老玩家好嗎！雖然卡面變華麗了，但效果不行。定位確實沒變，還是擋1刀然後抽牌，但加到4費比起原本的2/0/2盾還要難用阿！這交換力一樣是0阿！\n你不要以為換個卡面我就認不出來你原本騎的是巨魔(欸)。基本上就是重印哥布林巨魔騎士，5/3/6的無副作用守護某程度上也讓5/2/6 天女劍士 正式走入歷史。至於好不好用？如果你的構築原本會用到哥布林巨魔騎士，那你可以無痛轉換成這張哥布林山嶺巨獸騎士，爆能後就是5/3/6守護，跟原本只差1血，完全可以接受。\n二、能力與定位類似的不同卡片－你不要以為換了個卡面我就認不出你來\n這體質、這效果…你跟我說是「 創世龍 」Remake我也相信(雖然這隻巨蛇的典故差別不小)。實際上的運用除了可能比創世龍早個1~2回合以外大概沒什麼太明顯的差別(指定內的龍族卡片中沒有可以大量進化的)。無限制中也許可以跟「 尼普頓 」或「 大天使‧蕾娜 」作combo減到5費或者更低，就更有機會跟 烏爾德 Combo，但我覺得還是直接當小創世龍來用比較乾脆。\n雖然2/1/3是一個不太有利於前期交換的體質，不過這個骸骨蟲主要的價值多半是搭配新能力「葬送」以及一些戰鬥中被破壞的從者來回一波血，這張卡片大概不會2費準時下，因此戰鬥力就睜隻眼閉隻眼吧。\n5.寂靜的實驗室：初級鍊金實驗大升級，土片廉價化",

        "articleBody": "Somebody, please just snap a football.\nIt seems like a relentless wave of controversy, scandal, even death, followed us at every turn in the offseason.\nNow it's finally time to play -- and speculate. Pencil in Alabama and Clemson already? Is the game's best player a defender? Does the Pac-12 have a chance?\nCollege football needs to start celebrating itself after this troubling offseason. The sport is one year short of turning 150. Believe me, you'll read, hear and watch enough about that leading up to Nov. 6, 2019.\nFor now, here are 18 things you need to keep an eye on ahead the 2018 season.\n1. A relentless Tide: History awaits. Nick Saban goes for a record-breaking seventh national championship -- his sixth at Alabama -- this season. Seven would separate him from Bear Bryant for most titles won. A lot of us think Saban has achieved his own orbit already.\nWe are most likely living through the greatest dynasty of all-time. The SEC has never been better. Recruiting has never been more cutthroat. Saban has redefined strategy, work ethic and the game itself.\nHe deftly handled the transfer of quarterback Jalen Hurts that never happened. Somehow, a junior with a national championship ring and 26-2 record as a starter may end up being the backup this season. The assumption is that Alabama gets stronger if Tua Tagovailoa snags the job. \nThe Crimson Tide were the last team to grab a spot in the College Football Playoff and won only after trusting the championship game to Tua, a true freshman, at halftime. If that's backsliding, everyone would love to experience that type of weakness.\nAlabama is the favorite again this year, but there is a familiar challenger on the horizon …\n2. Clemson, too (or is it \"two?\"): Maybe the discussion shouldn't be about Alabama but a Clemson team chasing its second title in three years. Dabo Swinney has Clemson at one of the peaks in its history. This season, the Tigers could become the first ACC team to win four straight outright conference titles. The defensive line is historic. The quarterback depth is excellent. It will be an upset if Clemson and Alabama don't meet for a third straight season in the CFP.\n3. Choke hold: OK, assuming the Tide and Tigers are in, Cinderella's dress is in tatters. That's another way of saying the list of championship contenders is a small one. There's a group of 8-10 teams that can realistically win it all. Start with four from the Big Ten: Wisconsin , Ohio State , Penn State and Michigan . Continue with the SEC: Alabama, Auburn and Georgia . Add Clemson, and you've probably read this year's Football Four already in this paragraph.\n4. So who makes it to the CFP then? The winners will meet Jan. 7 in Santa Clara, California. Orange Bowl: No. 1 Alabama vs. No. 4 Wisconsin Cotton Bowl: No. 2 Clemson vs. No. 3 Georgia\n5. Urban Meyer's legacy: Right now, it is damaged. One of the greatest coaches of this era was suspended last week in a moral and ethical crisis that won't go away anytime soon. Any summary of Meyer's career now has to include the assertion Ohio State's coach overlooked an alleged domestic abuser in the name of winning games.\nFor a legion of Bucknuts, Meyer's three-game suspension is too much. For others, it will define who he is as a man and coach.  Questions about the veracity of the investigation will continue to linger, but if history is an indicator, football at Ohio State has always been bigger than the Ohio State football coach. Regardless of the fallout, the Buckeyes will keep winning. Big.\n6. Player safety: Two investigations are active at Maryland determining the circumstances surrounding Jordan McNair 's death. The school has taken responsibility for his passing. That's a start. An ESPN report detailed a \"toxic culture\" of training within the Maryland program.\nIt points to a larger issue in college football. The sport continues to put too much value in punitive training measures over a performance-based approach. The mentality goes back to the no-water days of Vince Lombardi and beyond.\nIt must end. Since 2000, almost 30 college football players have died. The overwhelming majority of them were in T-shirts and shorts -- practicing football, not playing, when they were stricken. Football has a problem with player safety. More must be done than what looks like the likely firing of Maryland coach DJ Durkin.\n7. Betting on a new era: College administrators are freaking about the new era of sports gambling. They don't quite know how to deal with one of their 21-year-old athletes legally placing a bet on a game but getting suspended for breaking NCAA rules. A handful of states will have sportsbooks open in time for the season. The concern is whether legal sports gambling makes it more or less likely that funny stuff ( game-fixing, point-shaving ) will be going on.\n8. Herm Edwards: I'm through asking, \"Why?\" I'm ready to say, \"Why not?\" … when it comes to Arizona State 's Grand Experiment. Everything else has failed in Tempe, so why not take a chance on a 63-year-old former TV analyst who has never been a college head coach.\n9. After Baker: Quarterback Kyler Murray was surprisingly taken in the top 10 of the MLB Draft in June. The Oakland A's are allowing him play a final year of football before Murray (supposedly) goes full-time to baseball. Possibly dumb for the A's if Murray blows out a knee. Great for the Sooners and Murray, who gets the best of both worlds. No pressure, kid. Murray is replacing the Heisman Trophy winner and expected to help win a fourth consecutive Big 12 title while leading the Sooners to another playoff berth.\n10. The Tom Mars Effect: Add the name of the Arkansas attorney to the list of the most influential figures in college football. The former director of Arkansas State Police and Wal-Mart general counsel has become one of the smartest people in the room wielding power behind the scenes.\nStart with the Houston Nutt lawsuit that led to the  resignation of Hugh Freeze last year at Ole Miss . That, in turn, led to transfer waiver requests by six Ole Miss players handled by Mars. All of them have earned their immediate eligibility for 2018.\nLately, Texas A&M is under NCAA scrutiny because of Santino Marchiol's transfer appeal led by Mars . If Michigan wins the Big Ten, Mars deserves a slice of the trophy. His dogged appeal on behalf of Shea Patterson led to Jim Harbaugh getting the difference-making quarterback he never had at Michigan. Mars has at once become an athlete advocate, watchdog and power broker.\n11. The SEC is back on top: With two teams in the title game last year and a number of new coaches joining the league, the SEC has regained its standing in the conference power rankings. SEC: Six deep, at least.  Big Ten: The East might be the toughest division in the game. Big 12: Oklahoma is favored again. West Virginia or TCU is No. 2. Is Texas back? ACC: Clemson is boat-racing the league. Hard to believe the Tigers play one currently-ranked team (Oct. 27, No. 19 Florida State ) Pac-12: The league went 1-8 in bowl games. Get back in the playoff, and we'll talk.  \n12. First coach to get fired: Kansas ' David Beaty is 3-33 in three seasons. He has a new athletic director in Jeff Long, formerly at Arkansas. If the Jayhawks win two this season, it would be considered improvement. If not during the season, shortly thereafter it seems Beaty will be let go. Here are the candidates.\n13. Most successful new coach: With apologies to Chip Kelly (UCLA) and Jimbo Fisher (Texas A&M), it has to be Joe Moorhead at Mississippi State in 2018. Moorhead has been gifted 16 starters. For nine years under Dan Mullen, the Bulldogs have played \"up.\" That should continue under Moorhead, who gets to work his offensive magic with Heisman Trophy candidate Nick Fitzgerald at quarterback. Mullen will get a shot at this title, too, taking over at Florida .\n14. Most likely to be shown to the hot seat: How many European capitals will Michigan visit before Jim Harbaugh beats Ohio State? OK, that's another way of saying that it's put up or shut up time for Harbaugh. Michigan's coach has his best team in his in his fourth season in Ann Arbor. There is a quarterback (Patterson), a stout defense and expectations out the wazoo.\nHarbaugh can stage all the overseas spring practices he wants (Italy and France have been conquered so far). It's getting noticeable he is 1-5 against Michigan State and Ohio State. Oh, and there is that trip to blood rival Notre Dame this week to kick off the season. (And for the record, Harbs, London, Munich, Geneva and Oslo are still out there for you.)\n15. God bless Bill Snyder: Kansas State 's forever coach will turn 79 in October. That's just the beginning for the man who fashioned the Manhattan Miracle. The game's oldest coach recently received a contract extension that will take him to age 83 in 2022. That would make him the oldest coach in college football since one Joe Paterno was fired at age 84 in 2011. Snyder still hopes to have input in naming his eventual replacement -- special teams coach and son Sean Snyder.\n16. Repairing Tennessee 's rep, psyche and program: After a protracted, ugly process, Jeremy Pruitt finally replaced Butch Jones in Knoxville. In between, Tennessee football made headlines for all the wrong reasons. The school could have produced a training film for how not to conduct a coaching search.\nAthletic director Phillip Fulmer finally hired a coach in his image. Pruitt will the run the ball and play defense. How quickly he does both those things well will determine if Tennessee has changed coaches or actually changed directions.\n17. Best player in the country vs. Heisman winner: The best player is Will Grier . West Virginia's quarterback has all the weapons to throw at least 40 touchdowns this season. His best receivers are back. His defense is sub-par. The combination means Grier and the Mountaineers will have to outscore everyone. Stanford 's Bryce Love has to be the Heisman favorite. On a healthy ankle, Love will rush for 2,000 yards and become the school's second Heisman winner.\nRemember, there frequently is a difference between the best player and Heisman winner. Voters usually put candidates in a box: They must be skill players on a 10-win team (or better) who do something dramatic in November. There is definitely that difference this season.\n18. The Group of Five playoff hope: Remember the Broncos? Boise State should be the Group of Five champion that gets the automatic New Year's Six berth (Fiesta or Peach Bowl this year). But given their reputation -- one of the original BCS busters -- can the Broncos snag a playoff berth? Yeah, it's a longshot. As far as schedule strength goes, their only Power Five opponent is Oklahoma State .\nIn coach Bryan Harsin's fifth year, Boise seems loaded enough to make an undefeated run similar to UCF . And we know what happened to the Knights. The NCAA just recognized their 2017 national championship claim .\nGosh, will Bama have to \"share\" the natty again?",

        "articleBody": "承襲ŠKODA SUV車系「K開頭Q結尾」的命名方式，KAMIQ乃是採用自加拿大北部以及格陵蘭的原住民族因紐特人語言，代表在每個環節都能完美匹配，亦即天生絕配之意，若是用當前的流行語彙表達：KAMIQ就是我的菜！\n▲生活休旅新境界 ŠKODA KAMIQ推出1.0TSI動能版、1.0TSI菁英版、1.5 TSI 豪華動能版以及1.5 TSI豪華菁英版共4種車型，提供消費者多樣化的購車選擇。\n設計新境界\n2018年三月日內瓦車展上ŠKODA曾介紹一款概念車Vision X，當時就昭告會以此為原型車發展第三款SUV，而事後也證明Vision X與KAMIQ之間的相似度高達90%。除承襲ŠKODA家族的水晶線條設計概念、車側高腰線之外，身為SUV車系成員，KAMIQ外型擁有濃厚的越野風：在車頭水箱罩下方設計了一個大型氣壩以及下護板，當然車身兩側以及車尾也都搭配下護板做為防護。此外，車頂行李架也是休閒生活不可或缺的配件，同樣在KAMIQ車上出現。另外一個吸睛處便是KAMIQ的四顆大LED日行燈所組成的燈眉，這也是ŠKODA設計師初次採取如此粗獷的手法設計燈組，雖然因為規格配備有所不同，不過分離式LED燈組已經是這款車的標準配備，豪華版的車型更加入動態序列式頭尾燈，成為家族中首款擁有動態序列式頭燈的車款。\n內裝部分，KAMIQ與甫於2月份在台發表的SCALA一樣，都採用ŠKODA家族最新一代的設計語彙：駕駛艙大幅運用高品質軟性材質，提供更佳觸感；正中間的獨立式螢幕清楚而醒目地提供駕駛者所需訊息；車門開關把手採取水晶切割線條概念，輔以按鍵上的閃亮水晶元素，清楚刻畫出ŠKODA品牌特色。手套箱上方大面積的亮面飾板，搭配懸浮式新世代MIB 8吋觸控螢幕，視覺與觸覺都擁有最佳質感。入門的1.0 TSI動能版與1.5 TSI菁英版採用藍色菱格紋織布座椅搭配綠色亮面飾板；而兩款動力的豪華版則採用黑色 Alcantara / 真皮 / 真皮透氣混搭座椅配合類木紋亮面飾板，兩者各自呈現自我風格。\n科技新境界\n採用集團共享的MQB A0底盤，KAMIQ的車身尺碼分別為車長4241mm、車高1553mm以及1793mm車寬，所擁有的2651mm軸距堪稱是同級競爭對手最長。在此同時，KAMIQ也調高了座椅高度，不僅在進出車室時更輕鬆，也讓駕駛者擁有絕佳的視野得以掌控交通狀況。而寬敞的室內乘坐空間向來是ŠKODA傲人之處，在KAMIQ車上駕駛與前座乘員可以擁有1051mm的頭部空間以及1439mm的肘部空間；後座更享有1003mm頭部、1425mm肘部以及73mm的膝部空間，堪稱同級車表現最優者。在行李廂部分，400公升的置物空間已足敷日常使用，若有更多需求的話，在可60：40向前傾倒的後座椅背支援下，最高可容納1395公升。除此之外，「聰明的就懂」的ŠKODA在車室內還提供多處置物儲存空間，整體容積高達26公升，可輕易解決車內乘員的置物需求。\nKAMIQ搭配1.0 TSI以及1.5 TSI兩款汽油動力引擎：直列三缸的1.0TSI擁有110匹最大馬力、20.4公斤米最大扭力，0~100km/h加速所需時間為10.0秒，極速 193km/h；而採用直列四缸的1.5 TSI則具備150匹最大馬力以及25.5公斤米最大扭力，0~100km/h加速所需時間為 8.4秒，極速212km/h，兩具引擎皆搭配DSG七速雙離合器自手排變速系統。而根據能源局所公布的數據顯示，KAMQI 1.0 TSI的平均油耗數據為17.0km/L; 1.5 TSI的平均油耗則為16.9km/L。\n安全與配備新境界\nŠKODA認為安全駕駛中最重要的元素是「人」，不過除此之外ŠKODA以滿滿的安全配備做為駕駛的最強後盾 ! 在KAMIQ上面，擁有完整的ADAS配置 (Advanced Driver Assist System先進駕駛輔助系統)包括：全速域ACC主動式定速跟車系統ヽFront Assist 前方輔助系統  (含AEB行駛中緊急煞車系統)ヽ車側盲點警示系統ヽ車道維持及偏移警示系統ヽ附圖像及車距顯示的倒車警示系統 (動能版與精英版僅有後方來車 ；豪華動能版與豪華菁英版則為前後方來車皆具)，所有車款皆列為標準配備。再加上傲視同級的九氣囊，無怪乎能夠拿到歐洲NCAP撞擊測試五顆星最高評價。\n在此同時，KAMIQ的貼心配備也足以傲視同級競爭對手。後座出風口ヽ四個USB-C充電插座ヽ駕駛座車門邊傘筒置物空間ヽ電動尾門以及眾多車內置物空間設計等，不僅駕駛可以享受駕馭樂趣，同車乘員亦被悉心呵護照顧。",

        "articleBody": "Sebelum Islam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah zaman Khalifah Ali karena pemberontakan Mu’awiyah di tahun 37 Hijriyah. 26 tahun setelah wafatnya Nabi. Islam sudah sempurna secara aqidah mau pun fiqih. Islam sudah sempurna sebelum Nabi Muhammad SAW wafat. Jadi baik Sunni dan Syiah yg sebagian besar sahabat Nabi itu aqidah dan ibadahnya sama: Islam.\nZaman Sahabat itu zaman terbaik Islam. Karena Islam saat itu sudah sempurna dan amat murni. Masih banyak orang2 yg melihat langsung amal ibadah Nabi, ngobrol bersama Nabi, berjuang bersama Nabi. Sementara kita di akhir zaman ini belum tentu benar karena sudah diselubungi fitnah.\nIslam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syi’ah karena faktor politik. Karena kekuasaan. Pendukung Ali disebut Syiah Ali yg kemudian disebut Syiah saja. Pendukung Muawiyah dan yg netral disebut Sunni.\nSetelah pecah itulah jalan sendiri2.\nImam Ja’far Ash Shadiq yg merupakan guru dari Imam Malik dan Imam Abu Hañifah membentuk Mazhab Ja’fari. Imam Malik yg merupakan guru dari Imam Syafi’ie membentuk mazhab Maliki. Imam Abu Hanifah membentuk mazhab Hanafi. Imam Syafi’ie guru dari Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Syafi’ie. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Hanbali. Mereka semua punya hubungan guru dan murid.\nDari sini juga perawi hadits Sunni dan Syiah jalan sendiri2. Imam Kulayni bikin kitab hadits Al Kafi. Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim dsb bikin kitab Shahih Bukhari, Shahih Muslim dsb. Sebagian perawi haditsnya dari Syiah bahkan di Rijalul Hadits ada yg disebut Rafidhi karena tak membolehkan orang bernama Mu’awiyah masuk ke rumahnya.\nAda juga percampuran Ilmu misalnya orang Syiah belajar dari ulama Sunni dan orang Sunni belajar dari ulama Syiah. Contoh kitab Subulus Salam yg biasa diajarkan di pesantren2 NU ternyata disusun oleh ulama Syiah.\nCuma sekali lagi zaman Nabi Islam sudah sempurna. Jadi saat para sahabat pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah, Islam mereka sudah sempurna meski saat itu mazhab fiqih dan kitab2 hadits belum ditulis.\nJadi keliru karena Syiah beda dgn Sunni langsung dibilang bukan Islam. Pelajari dulu sejarah Islam dari berbagai sumber. Bukan dgn 1 mata.⁠⁠\nPenghinaan terhadap Istri dan Sahabat Nabi\nSebelumnya kita tegaskan bahwa menghina istri Nabi Siti ‘Aisyah ra dan menghina Khulafaur Rosyidiin seperti Abu Bakar ra, Umar bin Khoththob ra, Usman bin Affan ra, dan Ali bin Abi Talib ra adalah perbuatan yang sesat. Harusnya dapat sanksi hukum misalnya 10 tahun penjara atau lebih berat lagi.\nSyi’ah Rafidhoh yang gemar menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi seperti Yasir Habib dan Tawhidi ternyata dipelihara Zionis Yahudi untuk memecah-belah Islam. Video Yasir Habib saat syahadah sering disebar ole Wahabi. Untuk menimbulkan kemarahan dan perang sesama Islam tentunya. Yasir Habib ternyata dipelihara London dan diberi dana untuk bikin Fadak TV. Tawhidi yang sekarang diundang ke Indonesia oleh Emilia Renita dari Oase dipelihara oleh Australia. Gunanya untuk membuat Indonesia kacau.\nBukan cuma istri dan sahabat Nabi yang dihina oleh Rafidhi macam Yasir Habib. Bahkan Imam tertinggi Syi’ah pun seperti Ali Khamenei mereka hina karena mengharamkan penghinaan tsb.\nAhmadinejad: Siapa Menghina Sahabat Rasulullah Sekutu Musuh Islam\nPresiden Ahmadinejad menandaskan, “Dari tribun ini saya tegaskan bahwa barang siapa di mana pun ia berada menghina sahabat Rasulullah saw, maka ia bukanlah seorang muslim dan tidak bergerak di atas jalan Islam. Ia tidak lebih hanyalah kaki tangan dan alat mainan musuh-musuh asing.”\nKhamenei: Haram Menghina Istri Nabi dan Simbol Ahlusunah\nFatwa Para Ulama Syi’ah Larangan Mencaci Para Sahabat\nSekarang kita lihat asal muasal penghinaan terhadap istri dan sahabat Nabi.\nSaya dulu merasa kehidupan semua sahabat rukun dan damai. Itu benar di zaman Nabi. Saat Nabi wafat, timbul perdebatan siapa yang berhak menjadi pemimpin ummat Islam sebagai Nabi. Kaum Syi’ah umumnya berpendapat Ali berhak menjadi Khalifah. Sementara mayoritas sahabat mengangkat Abu Bakar ra sebagai Khalifah. Suka tidak suka, semua sahabat membai’at Abu Bakar sebagai Khalifah. Termasuk Ali.\nSaat Ali jadi khalifah, Siti ‘Aisyah memberontak dalam perang yang disebut Perang Jamal yang menewaskan 17.000 orang. Saat Mu’awiyah berontak dalam perang Siffin pun ada 70.000 Muslim yang tewas. Dari pihak Ali 25.000 orang yang tewas. Dari pihak Mu’awiyah, 45.000 orang yang tewas.\nNah kalau para sahabat ini saling bunuh dalam Perang Jamal dan Perang Siffin, tentu diawali dengan perang lisan dan juga tulisan. Saling hina. Bisa jadi tulisan2 yang mengina sampai ke kita hingga sekarang. Ini mirip saat Pilpres 2014 antara Jokowi melawan Prabowo di mana masing2 pengikut menghina yang lain. Bahkan Jokowi difitnah sebagai kafir sehingga keluarlah foto2 Jokowi sedang sholat.\nItulah asal muasal penghinaan istri dan sahabat Nabi. Itu satu lembaran hitam sejarah yang harusnya kita tutup. Menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi yg dilakukan sebagian kaum Syi’ah dan menghina orang tua Nabi yg dilakukan Wahabi itu dosa besar. Cuma kalau taubat dan pemimpinnya mengharamkannya, ya selesai. Allah Maha Pengampun.\nManusia itu sifatnya salah dan lupa. Sebaik2 orang salah adalah orang yang taubat. Nabi Adam dan Nabi Yunus pun pernah salah, tapi begitu tobat, diampuni oleh Allah. Begitu. Makanya KH Quraish Shihab saat menilai Syi’ah itu sesat atau lurus, beliau juga melihat perkembangan mereka. Yang tobat dan mengharamkan penghinaan thd sahabat ya otomatis tidak sesat. Sebaliknya yang tetap menghina, ini sesat.\nPenghinaan pun macam-macam tingkatnya. Dari sekedar kritik yang santun, hingga penghinaan yang amat amat keji. Kitabnya pun ada. Sahabat yang dihina pun macam-macam. Dari sahabat Abu Bakar ra dan Umar bin Khoththob yang namanya dijamin Nabi masuk surga, hingga Mu’awiyah yang masuk Islam setelah Futuh Mekkah da anaknya Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, Sayyidina Husein ra.\nMenghina Siti Aisyah ra, Abu Bakar ra, dan Umar bin Khoththob ra tidak dibenarkan apa pun alasannya. Sesat. Sebaliknya menyatakan bahwa Mu’awiyah berontak terhadap Khalifah Ali atau Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, itu sekedar kritik berdasarkan fakta sejarah. Namun kaum Sunni tetap menjaga lisan mereka untuk tidak mengutuk atau menghina Mu’awiyah dan Yazid. Urusan mereka ada di tangan Allah.\nShare this:",

        "articleBody": "腾讯体育3月9日讯 北京时间3月10日，北京队将在主场与上海队展开季后赛附加赛10进8的第三场生死战，晋级还是回家，将在这一场比赛后见分晓。从CBA联赛成立至今北京队所经历的生死战共有4场，他们拿下了其中的3场，胜率高达75%！生死战前，北京队总能爆发出惊人的战斗力。下面来一起回顾北京队的这4场生死战。\n1997-98赛季 季后赛首轮2-1胜上海\n本赛季的北京队志在换血，巧合的是，20年前的他们也处于换血的阶段，而且季后赛的首个对手也是上海队，双方同样经过了三局两胜的生死战。当时时任球队队长的闵鹿蕾退役后成为北京队的主教练，北京队正式开始换血。闵鹿蕾执教的第一个赛季，北京队在“双塔”巴特尔和单涛的带领下杀进季后赛，首轮他们遇到了初入CBA的姚明所领衔的上海队，在前两场1-1战平的情况下，北京队第三场艰难击败对手，以总比分2-1晋级。\n2004-05赛季 季后赛首轮1-2负八一\n2004-05赛季后半段，从NBA归来的巴特尔加盟北京队，让球队实力大增，而且当时北京队还拥有尼日利亚国手奥德杰，两人组成的新双塔威力无穷，最终北京队时隔一年重返季后赛，剑指总冠军。可不幸的是，北京队在季后赛首轮碰上了拥有刘玉栋和李楠的八一队，双方战成1-1，可是第三战客场作战的北京队不敌对手，惨遭淘汰，这也是北京队在生死战中唯一的一次失利。\n2011-12赛季 季后赛次轮3-2胜山西\n那是马布里加盟北京队的首个赛季，他们在季后赛次轮碰上了老马的前东家山西队，两队的系列赛打得难解难分，直至最后第五场生死战。主场作战的北京队在马布里的带领下最终110-98击败山西队，挺进总决赛，马布里砍下30分9个篮板和8次助攻，之后他们又总比分4-1战胜卫冕冠军广东队，队史首次获得总冠军。\n2013-14赛季 季后赛次轮3-2胜广东\n这一轮京粤大战可谓火星四溅，前三场北京队一度取得2-1的领先，但是第四场广东队攻陷五棵松，扳平总比分。第五战虽然是客场作战，但是北京队从始至终都处于领先地位，最终以110-102淘汰广东队，时隔一年再进总决赛。马布里依然难以阻挡，他砍下31分5个篮板5次助攻，孙悦得到19分，另外易建联空砍30分9个篮板2盖帽。重返总决赛的北京队最后4-2战胜新疆队，再获总冠军。\n由此可见，当出现抢3或抢5的生死战时，北京队总能突围成功。尤其是马布里时代，四年三冠让北京队拥有比上海队更加深厚的底蕴，主要球员翟晓川、方硕、王骁辉和朱彦西等基本上都经历过生死大战的洗礼，在打硬仗方面很有经验，这从他们在3月7日客战上海时，方硕和王骁辉等屡中关键球的表现就能窥见一二，再加上拥有主场优势，所以北京队明晚获胜的希望很大。\n反观上海队，他们共经历过3次生死战，但全部告负，最近的一次是上赛季季后赛首轮第五场，他们在主场加时95-102输给了深圳队。上海队能打破宿命，像季后赛首战那样客场过关吗？唯有拭目以待。\n（紫薯） 正文已结束，您可以按alt+4进行评论",

        "articleBody": "DEAR ABBY: My husband of more than 20 years just purchased plane tickets to India. It’s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in business class, while I’m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply doesn’t want to spend it. He’s older and has health concerns and mobility issues.\nAm I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than his love for me? Or should I be content and happy I’m going to a beautiful country? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATE\nDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a beautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your penny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you than he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You have a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either sit together or he’ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a restaurant we’ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies’ room and was washing my hands when a waitress I don’t care for came barging in, got in my face and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn’t let me out of the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling me no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\nMy husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said that I started it. Another waitress who calls me her “sister” didn’t answer the texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she believes the waitress, too.\nThe restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn’t care. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I’m 74 and was tempted to go to the police but didn’t. Now I wish I had pressed charges. Should I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\nDEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have written, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and falsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to an emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about what the woman did to you.\nDEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our generation.\nA few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if her granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had asked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have grandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. -- CONCERNED SISTER\nDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don’t think your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was asked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that her granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually active, which made her defensive.\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Réouverture des terrasses et salles des restaurants, bars et cafés, jauges dans les commerces, musées ou dans les cinémas... Franceinfo fait le point sur les précisions de Matignon. \nLe 19 mai \n• Pour les restaurants, cafés et bars.  Les terrasses de ces établissements vont rouvrir à 50% de leur capacité d'accueil le 19 mai, avec des tables comptant six personnes maximum. Ces dernières devront rester assises. \n• Pour les commerces.  L'ensemble des magasins considérés comme non essentiels en période de confinement vont pouvoir à leur tour rouvrir le 19 mai. Un client à la fois sera autorisé dans les enseignes de moins de 8 m2, et un minimum de 8 m2 par client sera requis pour les magasins de superficie plus importante. La règle sera la même pour les marchés ouverts, et sera de 4 m2 par personne pour les marchés en extérieur.\n• Pour les musées.  Une jauge de 8 m2 par personne est également prévue pour la réouverture des musées le 19 mai. \n•  Pour les cinémas et salles de spectacle. Ces salles vont de nouveau accueillir du public le 19 mai, avec une capacité maximale d'accueil de 35% et un plafond de 800 spectateurs, précise Matignon auprès du  Parisien.  Cette règle s'appliquera également aux salles des fêtes et salles polyvalentes.\n•  Pour les  cérémonies religieuses et les mariages civils.  Ces cérémonies pourront avoir lieu avec seulement un siège sur trois occupé, et un fonctionnement en quinconce d'une rangée à l'autre. \n• Pour les salles de sport et les piscines.  Ces établissements pourront rouvrir dès le 19 mai pour  \"les pratiquants prioritaires\"  comme les mineurs,   détaille  Le Parisien.  La jauge sera de 35% pour le public, et un plafond de 800 spectateurs sera établi.\nLe 9 juin \n• Pour les restaurants, cafés et bars. Pour la deuxième étape de ces réouvertures, le 9 juin, les terrasses pourront cette fois-ci rouvrir entièrement, avec toutefois le maintien de tables de six personnes maximum. Les salles de ces établissements pourront également rouvrir, avec une capacité d'accueil de 50% et des tablées de six maximum également. \n• Pour les commerces.  La jauge par client évolue de 8 m2 à 4 m2 le 9 juin, dans les commerces comme dans les marchés en intérieur. Elle est levée pour les marchés en extérieur.\n•   Pour les musées.  Comme pour les commerces, la jauge sera de 4 m2 par personne dans les musées à partir du 9 juin. \n•  Pour les cinémas et salles de spectacle.   La capacité d'accueil passera de 35% à 65% le 9 juin, avec un plafond de spectateurs évoluant de 800 à 5 000 personnes.

        "articleBody": "(CNN) — Qingdao, a Chinese coastal city famous for being the headquarters of Tsingtao Brewery , is poised for a major tourism boost with the completion of the new Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport.\nConstruction wrapped up on June 24, according to Chinese state media , but an official opening date has not been announced.\nIt's taken five years and about RMB41.5 billion (or $5.8 billion) to build the new aviation facility, which spans 3,066 hectares -- twice the size of London's Heathrow Airport (1,227 hectares).\nIt will be the city's first 4F-class airport -- meaning its big enough to accommodate the world's largest commercial aircraft, including A380s and Boeing 787s -- making it a new transportation hub in Northeast Asia.\nAn aerial view of Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport on May 12, 2020.\nZhao Jianpeng/VCG/Getty Images\nCapacity to serve 60 million passengers\nLocated about 39 kilometers (24 miles) from Qingdao's city center, Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport was built to replace the saturated Qingdao Liuting International Airport. Currently the primary airport in Shandong Province, it was the 17th busiest airport in China , serving over 20 million passengers in 2016.\nThe new airport will dramatically boost the province's air traffic capacity.\nInitially, its two runways will be able to handle 35 million passengers, 500,000 metric tons of cargo and almost 300,000 landings and takeoffs by 2025.\nTwo more runways will be added in the second phase, according to Xinhua News , further increasing its capacity to 60 million passengers, a million tons of cargo and 452,000 annual landings and takeoffs.\nStaff members walk through the departure hall of the terminal building of Jiaodong International Airport.\nCHINE NOUVELLE/SIPA/Shutterstock\nPaper-thin roof, water-saving 'sponge airport' design\nSharing some similarities with the new Beijing Daxing International Airport , Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport is also shaped like a starfish, offering five connected concourses.\nThe design helps reduce walking distances between the main check-in hall and the farthest gates in the 470,000-square-meter terminal to no more than 550 meters.\nQingdao Jiaodong International Airport is topped by an ultra-thin stainless-steel roof.\nZhao Jianpeng/VCG/Getty Images\nYet unlike Beijing Daxing Airport's steel-and-glass roof, Qingdao's new airport features an ultra-thin stainless-steel roof that's just 0.5 millimeters -- the thickness of a piece of A4 paper. The roof, covering a total area of 223,000 square meters, is the largest of its kind in the world, according to state media reports.\nAnother similarity between the two airports is an emphasis on green water treatment systems.\nDubbed a \"sponge airport,\" Qingdao Jiaodong has been designed to absorb and store excess rainwater that can be recycled and reused when needed.\nHigh-speed rail and subway lines will connect Qingdao to the new airport, with officials saying it will take about an hour to travel from the city center to the new hub.",

        "articleBody": "Two hostages — an American and an Australian — who had been held by the Taliban in Afghanistan since 2016 were released Tuesday in a prisoner swap for three high-ranking insurgents.\nAmerican Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks, both professors at the American University of Kabul, were handed over to US ­forces in the country’s southern Zabul province, an insurgent source told Agence France-Presse.\nThe men were flown out of the region on US choppers, according to a local police source. Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed three Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar.\nBoth sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in stalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul government and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group’s 18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops.\nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban’s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla insurgent group’s Haqqani network.\nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a political office, according to a Taliban representative.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages “give[s] us hope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United States stands ready to support.\n“We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement.”\nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their ordeal. “We pray for the full recovery of both men,” said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. “We thank the Afghan government for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.”\nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last week , he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to the front line.\nHe also said he hoped the swap would “pave the way” for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate peace with Kabul.\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, “We are profoundly pleased and relieved” at the hostages’ release, adding that Weeks’ family had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart of Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two videos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale and gaunt.\nBoth men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their governments to help in their release — but it’s impossible to know whether they were forced to speak.\nUS officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the hostages at one point that failed to find the hostages.\nWashington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement for US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal when President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.",

        "articleBody": "2018-06-19 16:12\n　経済協力開発機構（ＯＥＣＤ）加盟国の統計によれば、２０１５年に日本に移民した外国人の数は前年比５万５０００人増の約３９万人だった。その数はドイツ、米国、英国に次いで世界第４位の規模であり、国籍別では中国人がもっとも多かった。中国は経済が成長していて、ビジネスチャンスも多そうだが、なぜ中国人は日本に移民したがるのだろうか。中国メディア今日頭条は１５日、「日本はそんなに暮らしやすい国なのか」と問いかける記事を掲載した。 　記事は、日本の在留外国人の統計で「韓国と中国が入れ替わり、中国人が最も多くなった」と指摘しつつ、事業に成功した中国人は「投資目的や生活環境、そして、子どもへの教育を考慮し、日本での生活に関心を寄せるようになっている」と主張した。そして、日中の生活水準と物価を比較し、日本の生活のどこが良いのかを分析した。 　まず衣料費について、「日本で売られているＴシャツの値段は輸入品であれば１０００円程度で買える」と指摘し、これは日本人の月収からすれば取るに足りない額だと説明した。また冬のコートは１ー２万円ほどするが品質が良いうえ、月収に対しては３％ほどに過ぎないと伝えた。 　また食費について中国では、「日本の果物は高価で、野菜は肉よりも高い」と知られているが、「食料品がすべて高額な訳ではなく、お手頃の物もある」と指摘した。高級食材以外では、コンビニなどで安い商品が売られていたり、安くて美味しいレストランもあると紹介した。 　住居については、「北京や上海と比較すれば東京の不動産価格はまだまだ安価で、しかも所有権を手にすることもできる」と伝え、中国では個人が土地を所有できないことを考えると、日本では個人の資産を守りやすい環境にあることを指摘。まとめとして「日本は物価が高い分、それなりに収入も確保でき、探せば安い賃貸住宅もあって資産の保全もしやすく、仮に収入が高くなくても生活の質は全体的に一定の水準を保てる」とまとめた。中国人にとって日本が暮らしやすいかはケースバイケースだが、在留外国人統計でもＯＥＣＤの統計でも日本で暮らす中国人が増えているということは、それだけ日本は暮らしやすいと言えるのではないだろうか。（編集担当：村山健二）（イメージ写真提供：１２３ＲＦ）",

        "articleBody": "We're just going to come out and say it: Women can run, lift, plank, and climb as well as (if not better than) any sweaty dude sporting a cut-off T-shirt at the gym. Sometimes, guys just need a little reminder that being a woman isn’t synonymous for being a weakling. Check out how seven women reduced big, bad men to little boys—and just try not to spit your protein shake all over the floor.\n“I’m 5 feet tall and weigh maybe 105 or 115 pounds. I wouldn't know exactly since I never get on a scale. But aesthetically, I don't look like a bodybuilder and my petite size is misleading. So one day, when the squat rack was free, I proceeded to start my warmup. As I was getting ready to start, this guy, maybe 6’7” tall, comes and asks how many I have left. I politely let him know I was just starting but that he could feel free to jump in. I let him go first. As he racked the plates, I warmed up doing burpees. When he finished, he started to take off a plate. I politely said, ‘No don't remove that.’ He looked at me, puzzled, and asked, ‘Are you doing the same weight?’ I smiled and said, ‘No, I want to add another plate.’ I started to do my set. Before I even finished, he had left.” — Malvina P.\n“I was doing a fitness challenge at my gym about five years ago and was paired against another guy. Each of us were supposed to hold a plank, which I love to challenge myself in, for as long as we could. Going into it, the guy was told that my previous plank personal record was seven minutes and 30 seconds. So guess what? He holds his plank for 7 minutes and 35 seconds. Then, I held mine for eight minutes and 20 seconds.” —Kimberly M.\n\"He looked at me, puzzled, and asked, ‘Are you doing the same weight?’ I smiled and said, ‘No, I want to add another plate.’\"\n“Shortly after we started dating, I asked my boyfriend to lift with me at my gym. According to him, he lifted every day, so I didn’t think joining me would be all that challenging. Little did he know, though, that he was walking into my territory, where chicks lift heavy and push just as hard as any guy. He ended up making it through about 20 minutes of my workout before he disappeared to the restroom for the next 20 minutes. He returned pale but ready to give it another go. Later that morning, he had to drive about an hour to work and actually had to walk backward up the stairs so his legs wouldn’t crumble under him. Today, we're married, and he survives the gym daily with me—but he still takes breaks in the bathroom while I secretly smile and continue my sets.” —Jess K.\n“While I was training for my first half-marathon , the weather forced me inside for more than a few long runs. About halfway through one, a guy hopped on the treadmill next to me. As I saw him peeking at my screen, he quickly adjusted his speed to exactly match mine. 'So annoying,' I thought. But I wasn’t going to screw up my pacing by trying to beat him at his own racing game. It turns out, I didn’t need to. About a mile into his run, he slowed it down to a walk, huffing and puffing like he had been doing an all-out sprint. I ran four more miles after that.\"  —Christine R.\n\"Little did he know, though, that he was walking into my territory, where chicks lift heavy and push just as hard as any guy.\"\n“I don't max lift often, but one day when I was max lifting on the leg press, I started with one plate on each side. The guy on the leg press next to me had three on each. I caught him glancing at my weight and giggling. His giggling subsided when he stopped at six plates on each side and I kept on going. I continued to add a plate to each side until I had 20 plates total. No, I can't do this every day and only did three reps with that weight—but I will admit that it felt good to shut that one dude up. Who knows, maybe he helped me PR that day.” — Angela H.\n“My husband and I used to do workout routines from health and fitness magazines together. I would pull out my sets of weights and tell him to get heavier ones. But he usually ended up grabbing lighter ones like mine, resting more, and complaining. He wasn't a fan of my tips on his technique and form, either. We've done more separate workouts lately.

        "articleBody": "In July 2018, we recommended a $5.1 million grant to Evidence Action Beta to create a program dedicated to developing potential GiveWell top charities by prototyping, testing, and scaling programs which have the potential to be highly impactful and cost-effective.\nThis grant was made as part of GiveWell’s Incubation Grants program, which aims to support potential future GiveWell top charities and to help grow the pipeline of organizations we can consider for a recommendation. Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures , a large foundation with which we work closely.\nThis post will discuss the following: Why Evidence Action Beta is promising. ( More ) Risks we see with this Incubation Grant. ( More ) Our plans for following Evidence Action Beta’s work going forward. ( More )\nIncubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\nA key part of GiveWell’s research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs . GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create … [an] incubator … focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them.\nWe have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, … our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities.\nWe believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling … promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta’s parent organization, Evidence Action , leads two of our top charities ( Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season ) and one standout charity ( Dispensers for Safe Water ).\nModeling cost-effectiveness\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant’s cost-effectiveness.\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could.\nThis could occur: if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities—in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities’ funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities’ funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn’t direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly.\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta’s incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here .)\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant : note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research.\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers , but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\nRisks to the success of the grant\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant: Few programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell’s 2017 top charities , or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact. We expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities , end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\nGoing forward\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely.\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.

        "articleBody": "Breaking with decades of United States policy favoring free trade, President Donald Trump has pursued an agenda favoring tariffs as weapons in a widening trade war. \n\"We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great betrayal is over,\" Trump said at a rally in Monroe, La., on Nov. 6, 2019. \"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\"\nBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly.\nTariffs have also strengthened the United States’ leverage after massive job losses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of Trump’s tariff decisions.\nMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary victims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while tariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy.\n\"As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\" said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. \"Tariffs, like any tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the trading relationship poorer — not richer.\"\nStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger fraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do.\nThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the United States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the world. \nWho pays the cost of a tariff?\nWhen the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn’t foreign exporters that make the payment. The importers do, and they’re usually U.S. companies.\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer — say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written . \"The Chinese government pays nothing.\"\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported . Companies that don’t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill.\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are high enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It’s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality.\nDon’t tariffs produce revenue?\nRevenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through June 30, 2019. \nThat’s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs. For context, that’s less than 2% of annual federal revenues. \nMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two years.\nHow big an impact have the Trump tariffs had overall?\nAs we’ve noted , a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods, \"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\nSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era tariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by 2020. If that holds up, that would work out to a $75.3 billion dollar hit on economic growth, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who studies U.S.-Canada trade.\nOther estimates are in the same ballpark. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump administration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while lowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent jobs.\nWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too. Facing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer Chinese goods, thereby hurting China’s gross domestic product. \nWhat tariffs has the United States imposed?\nIt started with washing machines and solar panels in February 2018, followed by steel and aluminum in March 2018. \nChina-specific tariffs took effect in July 2018, primarily covering machinery, followed by additional tariffs on China in August 2018 that covered plastics, more machinery, and electrical equipment. \nThe first big expansion into consumer goods from China came in September 2018, affecting home goods, electronics, furniture, backpacks, and other goods. Tariffs on Chinese goods were increased from 10% to 25% in May 2019, and the list of impacted goods expanded in September 2019 to cover some clothes, shoes, televisions and Bluetooth devices. \nTariffs have also been imposed on imports from the European Union, including many food products.\n\"The overall impact is now over $4 billion per month in extra tariffs on a wide range of goods,\" said Daniel Anthony, vice president of the Trade Partnership, a trade-focused consulting firm in Washington. \nWhat are the major products or sectors that have suffered negative impacts from tariffs?\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers . \nU.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. (Bad weather and other factors may have had an impact as well.)\nIn the meantime, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs.\nComputers and electronic devices have seen impacts, too, said Mary E. Lovely, a Syracuse University economist. \"About 36% of imports from China to the U.S. are computers and electronic devices,\" she said.\nAnd U.S. imports of \"intermediate goods\" from China, such as motors, pumps, and semiconductors, have seen price increases , harming U.S. producers. \"When the price of these inputs go up, U.S. businesses find it harder to compete against non-U.S. competitors, even in the U.S. market,\" Lovely said.",

        "articleBody": "A soothing pillow and warm duvet might not always lead to better rest. A 43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling extreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet lung,\" according to a new case report. \nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained malaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed CT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs. \nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather bedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a compound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was diagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said. \n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study. \nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\" \nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports . 27 Oddest Medical Case Reports 10 Strangest Medical Cases 11 Weird Things People Have Swallowed",

        "articleBody": "整體而言，台灣核備銷售的股票型基金在上半年的美元平均報酬率為 10.59%，而債券型基金的美元平均報酬率則是 0.15%。\n上半年，美國股市仍舊延續疫情爆發以來由 FED 量化寬鬆政策所支撐的多頭行情表現，雖然冬季期間美國國內疫情發展一度惡化，但隨著疫苗加速接種，新增確診病例數與死亡人數在過去幾個月已呈現明顯下滑，經濟復甦腳步也隨著各地陸續解除防疫封鎖措施而有加快跡象，期間通膨數據的大幅攀升曾引發投資人擔憂 FED 可能提前採取緊縮貨幣政策，但這樣的疑慮並未對股市造成持續性的影響，市場在大部分時間還是維持偏向樂觀的投資情緒。 美國三大指數在類股輪漲下，都刷新歷史新高的表現，道瓊工業指數與 S&P 500 指數在上半年分別上漲 12.73%、14.41%，NASDAQ 指數的漲幅也來到 12.54%。\n從經濟基本面來看，上半年美國國內經濟仍保持既定的穩健復甦態勢，並且隨著疫情趨緩以及防疫措施的陸續解封，加上政府推出大規模紓困方案的刺激下，近期的復甦腳步有更進一步加快的現象，尤其是最新公布截至 6 月 26 日為止的一周初領失業救濟金人數已下降至疫情爆發以來的最低水平，且 6 月新增就業人口也創下去年 8 月以來的最佳成績，這些就業數據的大幅改善，反映出經濟解封後受創最深的服務 業活動已逐漸恢復至正常水準。值得注意的是，隨著各項經濟數據的持續改善，研究機構也陸續大幅調升美國今年的經濟成長預測，包括 國際貨幣基金會(IMF)稍早前已將美國今年的 GDP 預估成長率由 4.6%上修至 7.0%，而美國國會預算辦公室更是一口氣將預估成長率由先前的 3.7%加倍調升至 7.4% 的水平。\n另一方面，在全球供應鏈瓶頸尚未獲得解決，而國內市場需求已隨著經濟解封而大幅改善的情況下，美國國內通膨壓力也在近幾個月呈現急速攀升的趨勢，其中 5 月份核心消費者物價指數(CPI)年增幅已來到 3.8%，創下自 1992 年以來的最大升幅，而 FED 最重視的核心個人消費支出指數(PCE)也在 5 月份創下 3.4%的近 30 年新高，FED 將加快縮減購債腳步並提前升息的說法一度甚囂塵上，所幸FED主席鮑威爾在最近一次的國會聽證會上發言時仍重申，近期通膨只是受到暫時性因素驅動，並強調FED並不會急於採取先發制人式的升息措施，明顯偏向鴿派的言論也成功安撫了市場的不安情緒。\n就基金組別的表現來看， 美國一般股票型基金在今年 1~6 月份的美元平均報酬率介於 13.08%~16.32%之間 ，上半年市場呈現類股輪動態勢，然受到公債殖利率上升的影響，市場資金一度由高估值的科技股與大型成長股流向價值股與景氣循環股，之後隨著投資人擔憂 FED 提前升息的疑慮逐漸平息，科技股的股價表現於 6 月份再度轉強。不過，以整體上半年的表現來看，大型價值型股票基金的績效仍然居於領先，而大型增長型股票基金的平均漲幅則是略為落後。\n在產業型基金的部份，上半年在亞洲國家疫情仍然反覆不定的情況下， 投資人持續看好遠距工作與教學的需求，通信類股表現依然強勁，帶動傳媒及通信基金在上半年的表現，該組別的美元平均報酬率達 33.89% ，表現居所有產業型基金之冠。另外，隨著歐美國家經濟陸續解封以及市場需求的回升，國際油價在 6 月份出現逼近每桶 75 美元的高位，創下 2018 年 10 月以來的最佳紀錄，激勵能源類基金在上半年的走勢，該組別美元平均報酬率為 28.55%，表現僅次於傳媒及通信基金。至於績效落後的產業型基金部分，受到投資人猜測FED升息時間提前，帶動美元匯價止跌反彈的影響，黃金價格在上半年由原本每盎司 1,900 美元的高位下跌，最低甚至一度跌破 1,700 美元的水平，連帶拖累貴金屬基金上半年的績效表現，該組別上半年平均下跌 7.81%(美元 報酬率)，在所有產業型基金當中表現墊底。\n歐洲股票\n不同於 2020 年，今年 上半年歐洲股市表現明顯優於美股 ，主要是去年疫情期間在歐洲股市中佔比較高的能源、汽車、工業等景氣連動股票的下跌，對歐股造成較大的負面衝擊。但今年以來，歐洲地區疫情逐漸趨緩，景氣復甦在望，吸引資金回流去年跌深 的價值股與景氣循環股，帶動歐洲股市出現落後補漲行情。 歐洲三大指數中的德國 DAX 指數在上半年上漲 13.21%，法國 CAC40 指數的漲幅更來到 17.23%，英國股市則在英國央行可能會早於歐洲升息，以及 DELTA 變種病毒導致國內疫情復燃的影響下，上半年表現落後歐洲大陸市場，漲幅僅 8.93% 。\n整體上來看，歐洲地區經濟復甦步調雖然落後於美國，但在各國持續加速施打疫苗的進展下，不論是疫情或景氣展望皆朝向正面的方向發展，除了各國政府陸續解除 或放鬆各項防疫管制措施外，歐盟也自 7 月 1 日起開始啟動數位疫苗證明，鼓勵歐洲民 眾在暑假期間恢復正常旅遊活動，可望進 一步加快歐洲經濟的復甦腳步。 日前 IHS Markit 最新公布的 6 月份歐元區製造業採購經理人指數(PMI)已來到 15 年新高，同時間歐元區服務業 PMI 也創下自 2018 年 1 月以來的最佳成績， 反映疫情對於歐洲整體經濟活動造成的負面影響已逐漸消失。\n隨著更多數據證明歐洲經濟正加速由疫情中復原，歐洲央行也在 6 月初的利率決策會議中將今、明兩年的經濟成長率預估由原先的 4.0%、4.1%分別上修至 4.6%、4.7%。不過，在調升經濟成長預測的同時，歐洲央行仍預期第三季為刺激經濟而實施的購債 計畫執行速度將會快過於今年上半年，顯示其短期內並無意調整現行的超寬鬆貨幣政策，而這也將持續為歐洲股市引進更多資金動能。\n基金組別表現部分， 區域型歐股基金在上半年期間以美元計算的平均報酬率介於 9.02%~16.36%之間 ，似乎並未完全反映歐洲股市的漲幅，主要是受到歐元兌美元匯價顯著貶值的影響，若是以原幣計算，其實際平均漲幅將會提高至 11.61%~20.05%的水平，其中又以歐洲靈活型股票型基金組別表現最佳，歐元區中型股票基金與歐洲大型增長型股票基金則是表現相對落後。 在單一國家的部份，法國中小型股票基金與俄羅斯股票基金的上半年美元平均報酬率分別為 17.85%與 16.69%，漲幅領先其他 歐洲單一國家股票型基金 ，前者反映出去年因疫情受到重創的中小型股票在 2021 的上半年重獲投資人的青睞，後者則是因為油價大漲帶動能源股強勁反彈。至於表現最差的單一國家組別-西班牙股票基金，今年上半年以美元計算的平均報酬率為 2.61%，是唯一報酬率不到 5%的歐洲單一國家股票基金。\n上半年，亞洲各國股市表現呈現相當大的落差，雖然整體而言仍延續自 2020 年 4 月 以來的反彈格局，但基本上只有 南韓、台灣、 越南等少數市場有著能夠與歐、美股市媲美的漲勢 ，主要是亞洲各國在疫苗接種率普遍偏低的情況下，近期許多國家的疫情又有再度惡化的趨勢，尤其東南亞地區國家在必須持續實施嚴格的防疫措施情況下，不僅外資持續呈現賣超，本地投資人進場意願也相對不足，以致股市表現受到影響。\n相較於東南亞市場因為疫情導致漲勢受限， 台灣雖然自 5 月份開始也爆發從去年以來首度大規模的本土疫情，並一度導致台股出現重挫，但在政府實施三級警戒措施後，疫情很快就獲得一定程度的控制，隨著本地投資人信心重獲提振，市場也迅速反彈回到疫情爆發前的高點 。另一方面，表現不 惶多讓的還有越南股市，上半年漲幅高居亞洲區域之冠，主要原因也與台灣相似，除了防疫有成以外，5 月份國會改選順利完成，消除政治面的不確定因素，加上本地投資人踴躍投入股市，累計上半年前 5 個月新增證券開戶數便超越去年全年的水準，都是推升越南股市上漲的重要因素。\n就亞洲股票型基金的整體績效來看， 區域型股票基金在上半年的美元平均報酬率介於 3.27%~15.62% 之間，其中以 亞洲不含日本中小型股票型基金組別表現最佳 ，而東協國家股票基金的績效則是相對落後。在 單一國家或市場的部份， 越南股票基金上半年的平均漲幅高達 30.37% ，表現居亞洲單一國家基金之冠。台灣中小型股票基金與台灣大型股票基金以美元計算的平均報酬率分別為 29.08%、23.32%，表現僅次於越南股票基金，至於表現最差的組別則是印尼股票基金，上半年的美元平均報酬率為-11.87%，日本靈活市值股票基金則是平均下 跌0.28%是唯二交出美元報酬率為負值的亞 洲單一國家基金組別。\n債券市場\n隨著歐美疫情逐漸趨緩、各國政府紛紛祭出大規模紓困方案，但全球債市並未因此而受惠， 整體債券型基金於上半年表現明顯落後於股票型基金 。由於各地陸續解封後，出現消費支出需求強勁反彈，但在供應鏈瓶頸問題尚未解決的情況下，供需失衡使得物價開始顯著上揚，投資人擔憂通膨 升溫壓力下將迫使各國央行貨幣政策由鬆轉緊，因而帶動公債殖利率快速向上攀升， 美國 10 年期公債殖利率由年初的 0.92%，一度衝高至逼近 1.8%的水平，之後雖在央行官員反覆重申不會急於升息的言論下， 緩步回落至 1.4%~1.5%的區間，但年初那一波的賣壓對債市的傷害已經造成，包括政府公債與投資級企業債均出現顯著跌幅。 所幸，全球經濟復甦腳步加快，與景氣變化呈現正向連動的可轉債與高收益債仍然獲得許多資金的青睞。以不同類債券型基金 的美元表現來看，上半年績效前十名的組別中，可轉債基金與高收益債基金分別佔據 2 席與 3 席位置，但若是以原幣來排序，將有 3 類可轉債基金與 5 類高收益債基金擠入前十名之列，反映出儘管上半年的大環境對債市相對不利，但投資人傾向追逐 風險的投資標的，因而對可轉債基金與高收益債基金帶來有力的支撐。除了可轉債基金與高收益債基金外，受到通膨持續升溫的影響，具備抗通膨效益的通膨連結債券也有著不錯的表現。\n在績效表現相對落後的基金組別部分，日圓債券基金與歐元政府債券基金上半年美元平均報酬率分別為-7.82%與-5.81% (原幣報酬率-4.9%、-2.82%)，表現居所有債券型基金之末位，除了受公債殖利率反彈的影響外，日圓對美元貶值超過 6%，而歐元對美元貶值約 3%也是拖累該二組別美元報酬表現的原因。此外，在上半年美元計價績效最差的 10 類債券型基金中，有高達 6 種基金類型都是以歐元計價，由此也可看出匯率變動對債券型基金報酬表現所帶來的影響。\n關於 Morningstar 亞洲及 Morningstar, Inc.

        "articleBody": "The core stage of the first SLS at Michoud Assembly Facility after the installation in early November of its four RS-25 engines. (credit: NASA/Jude Guidry)\nSeeking a bigger role for a big rocket\nby Jeff Foust Monday, November 18, 2019\nEarlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of its long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four RS-25 engines into the rocket’s core stage. With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a “Green Run” test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch.\n“If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,” Cooke said.\nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA’s exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX.\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isn’t using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches.\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration’s own party in Congress. “Every space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,” said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee’s space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA’s exploration plans.\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.)\n“While I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,” he continued.\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA’s approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA’s current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. “The fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,” said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee. (Cooke’s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS core stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views long before working with Boeing.)\n“If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” Stafford said of returning to the Moon.\n“SLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry Orion,” he continued. “If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date.” He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two SLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the two rendezvousing in lunar orbit—no Gateway required.\nAt last week’s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom Stafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them about the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission safety.\n“The mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,” Stafford, a member of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke’s earlier testimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success with the current multiple-launch approach. “I cannot disagree with it.”\n“But with eight launches, I’ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of success goes down to about 50 percent,” he concluded.\n“Oh my,” Lucas responded with a sigh.\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-lift launch vehicle. “If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” he said. “You have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big, wide-diameter booster. If you don’t have it, you’re not going to make it.”\nYoung, in his testimony, didn’t specifically address the use of SLS versus commercial rockets, but did criticize what he called “experiments” in procurement. “Managing and contracting experiments must be excluded from the Mars-Moon program,” he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment, he brought up the HLS program.\n“A management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to the surface of the Moon,” he said. “I personally think that these should be government-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.”\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human spaceflight. “The plate is really full today,” he said. “I personally think that the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number two is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done that will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.”\nOne thing Young would push off NASA’s plate is the Gateway. “I do not really see a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,” he said, although it could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. “There’s not a compelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.”\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.”\nLast week’s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of Congress questioned NASA’s use—or unwillingness to use—the SLS. At a hearing last month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater use of SLS.\n“I understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for SLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,” he said, including the first Block 1B. “What do you think?”\n“It depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,” responded NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn’t funding to support that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n“We haven’t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we’re guaranteed the second core we’d need for a Moon landing in 2024,” added Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA and the other witness at the hearing.\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced by 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first crewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024 that would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface of the Moon. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.”\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. “What commercial launch vehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to launch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the Moon by 2024?”\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But for the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy and Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman’s OmegA.\n“There could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,” Bridenstine added. “We’re not shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some investment from Boeing to achieve.”\n“What is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not available by 2024,” Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy is, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles—or SLS.\n“But if commercial’s not available, what’s the contingency plan?” Aderholt asked again.\n“I think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing in 2024 very, very difficult,” Bridenstine said. “If we don’t have the additional rockets, then we’re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu we’re confident we’ll have those rockets.”\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” Babin said of potential spending shortfalls for Artemis.\nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets, citing Cooke’s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged that more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall architecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more launches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n“We’re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing System how their systems ought to be developed,” Bridenstine said. “We’re waiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we’ll assess their approaches.”\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that its approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day the proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would involve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n“Using the lift capability of NASA’s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have developed a ‘Fewest Steps to the Moon’ approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,” Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the “national team” led by Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin’s New Glenn vehicles would be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely believed to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that.)\nNASA’s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House nor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion budget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis on track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. José Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose.\n“It’s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don’t know the costs down the road,” Serrano said. He suggested pushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to this March, “in order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.”\nBabin referred to those comments at last week’s hearing, concluding that the odds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were ”dwindling.”\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” he said. “This could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments already made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.”\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA’s architecture for returning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also include revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.\nJeff Foust ( jeff@thespacereview.com ) is the editor and publisher of The Space Review, and a senior staff writer with SpaceNews .

        "articleBody": "說到橘子風味汽水，很多人第一直覺想到的就是大名鼎鼎的「芬達（Fanta）。可口可樂公司（Coca-Cola）所推出的芬達汽水雖然在全球已經有上百種口味，但是令人最印象深刻的始終是其鮮豔的橘色造型。\n不過你知道嗎？芬達其實是二戰時期於德國誕生的產品，而且一開始竟然因為可口可樂原料短缺，而使用水果殘渣等原料製作出來的替代方案！\n1923年，羅伯特·伍德拉夫（Robert Woodruff）上任可口可樂總裁，他是將可口可樂推廣到全世界的重要推手。透過設立外交部、授權各國建造自己的裝瓶廠、以及1928年贊助荷蘭阿姆斯特丹舉辦的奧林匹克運動會，讓可口可樂的商標迅速在整個歐洲拓展，最終來到了德國。\n在德國可口可樂負責人雷·鮑爾斯（Ray Powers）努力下，可口可樂在德國的銷售量從1929年的6000箱激增至1933年的10萬箱。1933年阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler）上台後，宣告第三帝國納粹的統治正式展開。鮑爾斯與其助手德國人邁克斯·基思（Max Keith）當時仍以可口可樂的繁榮為首要任務，藉由贊助1936年的柏林奧運會等在地化經營策略，讓可口可樂成功在德國連年創造全新的銷售紀錄。到了1939年，可口可樂在該國擁有43個裝瓶廠和600多個分銷商，甚至可以年銷售300萬箱可樂。\n但好景不長，1938年鮑爾斯因車禍去世，基思接任成為德國可口可樂最高負責人；1939年第二次世界大戰爆發，1941年珍珠港事件爆發後美國正式參戰，並宣布德國為敵人，按照對敵貿易法（Trading with the Enemy Act）全面切斷對德的供應。基思完全失去了所有可以製造可口可樂的原料來源，但他不願意放棄。\n德國可口可樂停產後，基思讓研發人員著手開發全新的替代性軟性飲料。最終他們將其他食品業中產生的殘渣，包括乳酪的副產品乳清、蘋果酒壓榨後剩下的蘋果纖維等物製成一種全新的飲料。由於基思在要求研發人員研發時，要求他們全力探索自己的想像力，因此這款飲料取德語的「Fantasie（幻想）」中的「Fanta」命名。芬達因此誕生！\n1940年代，芬達汽水在德國刊登的廣告。（圖片來源：TIMELINE）\n由於當時德國完全沒有其他軟性飲料存在，芬達成為了德國人唯一的選擇，僅在1943年就大賣300萬箱。有趣的是，一些家庭主婦買回去根本不是用來喝的，而是用來調味或燉菜，因為當時國內糖的供應量也很短缺。\n戰爭期間，位於荷蘭阿姆斯特丹的可口可樂公司同樣遭遇原料短缺的難題，基思分享芬達的配方與品牌供他們使用。但兩國採用的配方原料並不相同，荷蘭以接骨木的漿果為主。\n直到1945年二戰結束前，可口可樂位於美國亞特蘭大的總部始終不知道基思究竟是為公司工作、抑或是為納粹工作，因為彼此根本沒有溝通的管道。因此在戰爭結束後，隨著德國與荷蘭的可口可樂分公司經營權回歸，芬達因此停產。\n隨後，可口可樂公司委託調查員查清基思是否與納粹有所聯繫，最終報告表明，基思從未成為納粹的一分子，雖然被迫為納粹政府工作，但他讓可口可樂德國工廠在戰時也能運作，並確保所有公司內部人員都能活著。由於他努力維持著公司的利益，讓可口可樂幾乎在戰爭結束後就可以立即恢復在德國的生產。\n雖然最終確知，基思並非納粹份子，芬達的誕生也並非納粹所要求研發，但芬達仍然因此停產了10年。直到1950年代，由於可口可樂老對手百事可樂開始積極打廣告，推出好幾款新飲料，讓芬達有機會重新推出。\n1955年，可口可樂重新推出芬達，但已不是最初以水果殘渣或接骨木漿果為主的版本，而是以義大利拿坡里（Napoli）產的柑橘製成，也就是我們如今最為熟知的版本。此舉被視為是要降低與德國的連繫，畢竟芬達是納粹時期的產物是鐵錚錚的事實。\n2015年，可口可樂慶祝芬達推出75週年時，曾因為廣告以「重返美好時光」為主題而被抗議：難道可口可樂認為納粹時期是美好時光嗎？可口可樂後來緊急撤下廣告並道歉，但發言人也強調，「這個已經75年的品牌與希特勒、納粹毫無關係。」雖然芬達的起源爭議時不時會受到挑戰，但無可否認，憑藉著色彩鮮豔的品牌識別，如今芬達已經成為世界上最暢銷的飲料之一。\n芬達75週年時，於德國推出的限量紀念版本，據悉其保留了正宗的戰時風味。（圖片來源：維基百科）",

Why it’s crucial, actually!\nI’ll share a free tool that will help you put your business in focus and pinpoint what to work on right now — in less than five minutes.\nIf we haven’t met yet, my name is Pamela Wilson — and I have been working online since 2010.\nI’m a three-time author, a keynote speaker, and an online educator, coach, and mastermind group leader.\nI help people build online businesses they  love .\nIn this article I’m sharing my approach to online business growth .\nIt was born from helping thousands of people create the online presence they’ve dreamt of — and seeing way too many of them lose focus and struggle to get any results at all.\nOnce you understand my simple approach, you’ll feel much better about where you are in the online business growth process — and that’s a promise.\nHow can I promise you’re about to feel better?\nBecause once you understand my approach … You’ll recognize you don’t have to master everything about online business all at once Your to-do list will shrink to 25% of its current size You’ll be able to safely ignore 75% of the online information you’re seeing right now\nGet ready to start  enjoying  the process of building your online business — maybe for the first time ever!\nIf you are … Trying to build an online business because you have deep expertise on a specific topic — but you’re “on hold” because you’re feeling overwhelmed Wanting to leave a legacy of information and guidance around a topic you’re passionate about — but you don’t know where to start Passionate about the business idea you’ve imagined — but unsure about how to make it happen\n… stick around.

Not paying attention to this will virtually guarantee that you will stay stuck where you are.\nAnd you’ll have a lot less money in your bank account.\nHere’s the thing …\nWhen you step into the online space, you’ll meet a whole new cast of characters. And they will try to sell you some pretty compelling stories.\nIt takes time to build a successful business — offline  and  online .\n(I know, radical statement, right?)\nI want you to embrace this reality — because I’m about to show you how to get time on your side.\nTrying to build an online business isn’t as simple as lots of people would have you believe. It has its challenges.\nThere’s a lot of technology to master. There’s marketing involved — a  lot  of marketing. Maybe more marketing than you’re comfortable with.\nAnd there are all these moving parts — disparate bits of software that needs to interact to present your business and your offers seamlessly.\nToday, I’m going to demystify the process of building your online business.\nYou’re about to save some major frustration, my friend. Money, too! Because it turns out your don’t need to Buy All The Things and Learn All The Things in order to make it online.\nI developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and error — mine, and the people I taught.\nIt’s called Plan & Grow BIG.\nFocus on what really matters in the near future of your business\nPlan & Grow BIG  helps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might be stopping you from making real progress in your online business.\nMaybe you’re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you’ve been trying for years to build a business idea you’ve had in your head — but it just isn’t living up to what you expected.\nEither way, you’re in the right place because today’s information will help you catapult forward.\nI developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting sidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they “needed” to master.\nFor example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads — before they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were going to offer.\nAnd I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was proven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an unproven product.)\nI saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. 🙁\nSmart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But they were completely baffled by this “online business thing.”\nTo be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the frustrations myself.\nTrue confession: I had to learn business focus the hard way\nBefore I outline the Plan & Grow BIG approach and the specifics for each stage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out.\nI’m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this.\nBack in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business, Zurek Design.\nI had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled projects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also juggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their “launch” phases — they were in high school and starting to look at universities and think about their careers.\nI didn’t have a lot of time to spare.\nPlus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become much more of a “public figure” than I had ever had to be in my business in the past. I’d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And I’d need to “put myself out there” on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars, and in online video.\nYikes.\nAnd although my offline business was making a solid income, my online business idea — to share my marketing and design training with others — wasn’t making a single cent.\nWho in their right mind invests in a business idea  before  they know if it will make money?\nI do, apparently!\nIt turns out that I was more courageous than I knew.\nBecause I did — I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course called Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time — an enormous amount of money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point.\nBut I’m glad I did.\nI truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that investment, I was telling myself, “This dream matters. This dream is going to become a reality. I’m taking this seriously.”\nOnce I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new, things started happening for me.\nWithin a few months, I (the person who didn’t want to be seen online) had an article accepted by the company behind the course I took — on one of the most-popular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger.\nThen another article went live. And another.\nNot just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the day.\nAnd through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then coaching.\nOut with the old, in with the new (and better)\nWithin a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline business made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to focus exclusively on my online efforts.\nThat’s what happens when you put your business in focus — and you spend time doing what really matters.\nNow, I’m considered an authority on building an online presence.\nThat company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach their audience for a couple of years.\nHere’s what’s different in my life now: My business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas) I am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from me My books are well-received and much loved — and deliver income to me every single month People find my website and join my community every day, all year long I’m able to travel anywhere I’d like because my business fits in my backpack I can “dial up” or “dial back” my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my schedule\nHere’s the other important thing …\nI also have complete control over the direction I take my business. I answer to no one but myself! And I can adapt my offerings to what my audience needs whenever I’d like.\nBut this story isn’t about me.\nWhat I’m about to share is the exact plan I’ve developed after seeing what truly works online.\nIt’s the approach that has allowed me to build the business I have today. A business where I’m in control — of my time, my projects, my earnings.\nAnd that’s what I want for you.\nReady to make online business building easier?\nYou wouldn’t have read this far if you didn’t also want to build this kind of online business!\nThat’s why I want to make it easier for you.\nWhat is your business focus right now?\nIf you can’t answer that question immediately, read on.\nHow to use Plan & Grow BIG to put your business in focus and get your mindset straight\nThe purpose of the Plan & Grow BIG approach is to help you develop business focus — and eliminate the feeling of overwhelm that keeps you from making progress.\nHere’s the thing:\nI want to show you how you can ignore most of the information you see!\nAnd how developing business focus will allow you to build the business you’re dreaming about much faster — and with less frustration.\nTo get started, I created a simple quiz that will help you get more value from this article.\nTake my Focus Finder quiz to pinpoint the stage you’re in right now — and get guidance about how to maximize your results.\nClick the button above so you can: Discover what business-building stage you’re in now Assess what you’re starting with — make a list of your current assets Pinpoint what your current business focus should be Get to know  what happens in the other business stages — so you can put your business in focus\nAs we go through each stage of the Plan & Grow BIG approach, I want you to identify areas of opportunity for your current situation.\nLet’s get started.\nThe four simple stages of Plan & Grow BIG\nThe Plan Stage: Think and dream productively\nIt’s the early days of your business.\nThink BIG. And work only on what’s needed in this stage.\nIn the PLAN stage, make these your business focus: Pinpoint your ideal customer: Who will your online business serve? Warning: many people try to skip this step — don’t! You need to become acquainted with the people you want to reach and help before you build your branding and offers. Get your branding in place: The earlier the better when it comes to building your brand. You’ll want to decide your business name and tagline, select your brand colors, and choose your brand fonts. Map out your first offer: Decide how what solutions you’ll deliver and how you’ll deliver them. Will they be products, services, or both?\nThat’s it. Once you’ve completed the items above, it’s time to start building your business, my friend. Ready?\nThe Build Stage: Create a tangible online asset\nTime to make ideas  real.  As you build these tangible business assets, remember: you don’t have to do it all at once.\nFocus on these business goals during the BUILD stage: Build your initial website: You’ll need a Homepage, an About page, a Contact page, and some kind of “commerce” page, like a Store or Services page. Attract prospects by publishing regular content like blog articles, podcast episodes, or a video series. Build your first offer: Don’t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that’s relatively simple — but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that. Build an initial funnel: Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers.\nAnd now … stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it’s tempting to look around at Version 9.0 of your competitors’ sites and feel like you have to catch up to them.\nNonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and be proud you’re ready to move on …\nThe Implement Stage: Iterate to find what works\nOooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can feel deeply uncomfortable.\nBut growth usually  does  feel uncomfortable, doesn’t it?\nThe IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that’s perfectly fine. Here’s what you’ll focus on while you’re there: Make your offers live: Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great — but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs. Focus on building your email list. Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list — think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a referral network. Discover what works for launching your products and services. Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience.\nRemember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to develop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business. Patience, my friend!\nBut once you’ve hit on a winning product or service, you’ll be ready for …\nThe Grow Stage: Leverage your success\nIn the GROW stage, you’ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably in your business — and now you’ll focus on leveraging that success. Improve your conversion rates: Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what’s working. You’ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible. Add more revenue streams: As you dial into what’s working well, you may uncover your customers’ unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You’ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream.\nThe GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are reliable and you’re able to make some serious investments in your business.\nReady? Set? Get your business in focus!\nNow that you know your business stage (you DID take the quiz , right?), you can tap into the power of focused attention and make fast progress. Ignore all the techniques you’ll need in future stages, and just aim to master the stage you’re in.\nGet the Online Business Success Roadmap for an overview and a handy checklist of all the Plan & Grow BIG stages.\nWhen you do this, you can count on steady business growth — with less frustration and more confidence because you’re focused on the right thing at the right time.\nThe next BIG challenge is …\nNow that you’re clear about how to use a focused approach to eliminate frustration and make faster progress, here’s the next big online business challenge …\nBecoming a “visible” and public leader in your space.\nThis was a HUGE stumbling block for me.\nIn the next article, I’m going to share my mindset tips and tricks to help you become more comfortable with becoming a visible online leader. Once you embrace the increased visibility that comes with building an online business, you’ll see all sorts of interesting doors open up.\nYour go-forward plan for business focus\nThe BIG question is, how do you successfully shape an online business dream into a viable online business that gives you the income, freedom, and recognition you deserve?\nIt comes down to business focus. Which is easy once you know  what  to focus on, and what to ignore .\nOnce you’ve built that business, you have to stand out in front of it and represent it in your marketing, on social media, and at in-person events.\nIf you don’t master this, you’ll severely limit your reach and your impact. So how do you get comfortable with this increased visibility?\nHow can you step up and embrace the “internet limelight?” Because once you do, online doors will open for you!\nRead about that topic in the next article in this series, How to Adopt an Online Leader Success Mindset .",

        "articleBody": "WASHINGTON – Two federal prison officers were charged Tuesday with falsifying records, stating they had checked on accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in the hours before he hanged himself in his Manhattan cell.\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, assigned to Epstein's special housing unit at Metropolitan Correctional Center, \"browsed the Internet,\" lingered in an office common area and appeared to sleep for two hours when they should have been conducting inmate checks.\nNoel and Thomas signed \"false certifications\" attesting they had made their required rounds, according to court records.\nProsecutors alleged that no inmate checks were made from 10:30 p.m. Aug. 9 to 6:30 a.m. the following morning, when the officers discovered Epstein's body. During that time, the officers should have conducted five separate inmate counts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly showed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night, according to court documents. \n“As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,” Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news release. “Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.”\nEach defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records. Noel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is charged with three.\nThe conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the charges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\nNoel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday afternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond within a week.\nEpstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many victims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related conspiracy charges.\nHis suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered multiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations at the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\nIndictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress \nAs the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage over the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the prison system.\n\"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer, repeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track of such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify against his other co-conspirators.\" \nProsecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from at least 2002 to 2005. \nSasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they’re not the end of this. \n\"These guards aren’t the only ones who should stand trial – every one of Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars,” Sasse said.\nHawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation and a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she acknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other instances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and falsified records to show that they had.\n\"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This incident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when something bad happens.\"\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems within the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\"\nAlthough representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier may have been murdered , Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports anything other than suicide.\nInvestigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself with a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered.\nFor months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned to Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks.\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do any rounds.\"\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters’ questions.\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. “It is our hope that we’ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,” said Jason Foy, who represents Noel. \nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would “ruin his life.”\n“We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,” Figgins said.\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they’re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they’re going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?”\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died. “When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you’ll have a different appreciation for what was going on.”\nPrisons plagued by understaffing\nPrison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised security at the Manhattan facility.\nStaffers 'don't care': Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union. Prison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said.\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, the one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system.\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center. \nAfter the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public’s trust in us.”\nEpstein removed from suicide watch\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell, semiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring   days later, which has drawn investigative interest. \nExperts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n“When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego.\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt.\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death. \n“Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.”",

        "articleBody": "Food Week\nIt's Food Week on PC Gamer, and we're looking at all the interesting ways games and grub intersect (hit points kinda relate to food!). Thanks to Drake's Cakes for sponsoring Food Week on PC Gamer. \nI don't remember which game we were playing, but it was the kind of Japanese RPG that listed everything you needed to know about its characters down the side of the screen. Magic points, coins, food, all summed up with helpful numbers. Only one of them was abbreviated: HP.\n“What does HP stand for in this game?” I asked my friend, an expert on JRPGs.\n“Health pineapples,” he confidently replied. “You have to knock all the pineapples off before you can hurt someone.”\nHP, whether it stands for hit points, health power, or indeed health pineapples, is one of many mechanics to come to video games via the original tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. However, the idea of representing the amount of punishment a character can take with a discrete number of points is much older than D&D. And while we might all know what the abbreviation means, it turns out that what hit points are meant to represent isn't quite so obvious.\n\"They didn't care if they could kill a monster in one blow, but they didn't want the monster to kill them in one blow.\" — D&D co-creator Dave Arneson\nIn a 2004 interview with GameSpy , D&D's co-creator Dave Arneson explained that the earliest version of the game didn't have hit points. The rules had evolved from wargames he and fellow D&D inventor Gary Gygax played, in which a single successful attack was all it took for a soldier to die.\nThat changed when they started experimenting with having players control individual heroes rather than entire armies, as players identified with them much more strongly. As Arneson put it, “They didn't care if they could kill a monster in one blow, but they didn't want the monster to kill them in one blow.” \nArneson had previously made his own rules for a naval wargame set during the Civil War called Ironclads, and together with Gygax had collaborated on a Napoleonic naval game called Don't Give Up The Ship! Both games had a mechanic that allowed for ships to take multiple hits before being sunk, which they'd borrowed from the wargaming rules designed by author Fletcher Pratt in the 1930s. They borrowed those rules again for D&D.\nIn his book about the history of simulation games Playing At The World , Jon Peterson explains why hit points were such an important idea: “Hit points introduce uncertainty and variance […] In Dungeons & Dragons, even when the prospects of a hit are near certain, the damage dice provide another potential survival mechanism via endurance, another way of forestalling death and increasing the drama of combat.” Art for Gary Gygax's Advanced Dugeons & Dragons Monster Manual, predating the earliest D&D PC games.\nFrom table to screen\nLike D&D, video game combat discovered a new sense of drama with hit points. Early arcade games like 1978’s Space Invaders typically killed players with a single successful enemy contact, using multiple lives to prolong the experience. Replacing that with the ability to survive a set number of hits before dying added a finer-grained rise in tension. It removes the frustration of being reset to the start of a level every time a player is so much as brushed by an enemy, and as the number of hit points remaining falls your anxiety rises in direct correlation.\nBeing on your last life may make you cautious, but there's a smoother transition with hit points. You gradually shift between playing more carefully as you approach half-health, biting your metaphorical nails as it dwindles below that, and sinking into erratic risk-taking when only a sliver of life remains.\nVideo games inspired by D&D were the first to copy hit points, as far back as 1975 games PEDIT5 and DND , which were coded for the PLATO system designed by the University of Illinois. DND was also the first game to have bosses, who could have hundreds or even thousands of what it called “Hits.”  Early RPG Dungeon (1982) for the PDP-10, which called hit points \"Hits.\" Image via the cRPG Addict\nThe first official adaptations of D&D to PC were the “Gold Box” series begun by SSI with 1988’s Pool of Radiance . They followed the rules of what was then called Advanced Dungeons & Dragons closely, which meant beginning characters had very few hit points. Playing around a table there’s always the option to fudge dice rolls to prevent deaths from feeling too arbitrary, but the computer was never so forgiving and players got used to reloading frequently.\nGames that weren’t licenced had no such problem. The first Ultima began players with a tidy 150 hit points, and the second with 400. Important non-player characters like Lord British had totals so high that killing him became seen as a challenge , and by Ultima III players were luring Lord British to the beach so they could attack him with cannon-fire, as if he was one of the naval ships in the wargames hit points came from.\nArcade games tended not to represent hit points numerically, however. Memorably, in the platformer Ghosts 'N Goblins (ported to the Commodore 64 in 1986) Sir Arthur lost his armor on taking damage, continuing to fight in his underwear.\nOne of the first game to represent hit points with the now familiar life bar was Dragon Buster , a 1985 dungeon crawler by Namco with a Vitality meter that changed from blue to red as you took damage from its bats, snakes, and “cave sharks.” While red life bars would go on to become standard, other ways of visualizing hit points have been tried with varying degrees of success. \nAtic Attack from the Rare Replay collection, Health Chicken half-eaten.\n1983 ZX Spectrum/BBC Micro game Atic Atac had a slowly depleting roast chicken that tracked your starvation, and dinosaur fighter Primal Rage used veins leading to a heart that exploded at the moment of defeat. \nOther games have tried to make their life bar a part of the game world, as in first-person Jurassic Park game Trespasser where it's a heart tattoo on the protagonist's breast you have to look down at to check. In sci-fi horror game Dead Space the life bar is represented by lights on the back of your armor, which would be very useful if you had a doctor standing directly behind you. Each of these visualizations is just a way of integrating a hit-point counter into the world, but in doing so they free the player from having to correlate a number with something that should feel real and immediate. They’re all still the same old hit points, under the surface.\nMIDI Maze\nThe true origin of BJ Blazkowicz and Doomguy.\nMIDI Maze , a 1987 first-person shooter on the Atari ST, was an early example of both the deathmatch shooter and the idea of representing hit points visually. Each player was a floating smiley face, like a three-dimensional Pac-Man, and an icon of that face at the top of the screen became sadder as they took damage. Later shooters like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom would copy this idea, their protagonists' faces growing more bruised and bloody as they absorbed bullet after bullet.",

        "articleBody": "Three cases of plague have been diagnosed in China, sparking widespread fears about the spread of the disease, though officials say the risk of an outbreak is low.\nAs Emily Feng reports for NPR , the first cases came to light last week, when authorities in Beijing announced that two infected individuals sought treatment at a hospital in the capital. The patients, a husband and wife, are from Inner Mongolia, an autonomous and sparsely populated region in the northern part of the country. They were diagnosed with pneumonic plague , one of the two main forms of infection caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis —the other being bubonic plague, which can advance to pneumonic plague if the infection spreads to the lungs. Yersinia pestis , per the WHO , is often found in small mammals and their fleas.\nPneumonic plague is the most deadly form of the disease. It is highly contagious, spreading from person to person via infected respiratory droplets. Without medical intervention, the disease is inevitably fatal. But recovery rates are high if it is detected and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.\nThe ailing couple was quarantined, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said it had conducted epidemiological investigations on people who might have been exposed to the patients, according to Sui-Lee Wee of the New York Times . All “relevant sites” were also disinfected, reports Wee. The CDC assured the public on Weibo , a Twitter-like social media site, that the risks of transmission were “extremely low.”\nOn November 16, a third case of plague was reported in a 55-year-old man, also from Inner Mongolia. He had, according to Alex Horton of the Washington Post , killed and eaten a wild rabbit before he was taken to a hospital around 185 miles northwest of Beijing. The man was diagnosed with bubonic plague.\nThe Associated Press reports that 28 people who came into contact with the patient were quarantined, and displayed no symptoms of plague—like the sudden onset of fever, body aches, vomiting and nausea. As yet, there is no epidemiological evidence linking the third plague case to the earlier two, the Inner Mongolia health commission said, according to Reuters .\nOver the centuries, plague has killed millions of people around the world, most famously during the Black Death , which wiped out nearly one-third of Europe’s population in the 1300s. Yersinia pestis is believed to have originated in China , spreading to the West via ships . Today, plague infections are rare, but they do happen. According to WHO , there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, with 584 deaths. China has experienced a small smattering of plague infections in recent years—26 cases and 11 deaths between 2009 and 2018, reports Reuters.\nThough the government has attempted to reassure the Chinese public in the wake of the recent diagnoses, many have voiced concerns that officials are minimizing or even restricting information about the cases.\nThe first two illnesses were confirmed on November 12. But according to NPR ’s Feng, Li Jifeng, a doctor at Chaoyang Hospital where the patients were treated, wrote in a blog post that the couple had been transported to the facility on November 3—nine days before an announcement was made, raising questions about the reason for the delay.\nLi explained that plague cases need to be carefully investigated and verified, and announcements about them cannot be “transmitted casually.” But her post was still taken down by censors. Wee of the Times reports that censors had also instructed digital news aggregators to “block and control” discussions pertaining the news about the plague.\n“Don't hide things like this,” one Weibo commenter said, per Feng. “Let’s face whatever it is together.”\nCurrent fears about a potential plague outbreak are perhaps being fuelled by China’s handling of past health crises. In 2003, authorities there were accused of concealing the true extent of the country’s SARS outbreak—and Beijing officials ultimately admitted that the city had experienced 10 times as many cases as they had initially reported.\nIn the wake of that outbreak, China “vastly improved its detection and management of infectious diseases,” writes the Associated Press . And though the Chinese CDC has said that there is “no need” for Beijing residents to worry about the risk of plague infection, it has also acknowledged that remote regions of the country—like Yunnan and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau—are vulnerable to outbreaks. Officials have warned people to stay away from infected areas, and to avoid contact with rodents.\nBrigit Katz | | READ MORE\nBrigit Katz is a freelance writer based in Toronto.

        "articleBody": "Hollywood Nation: Taylor Swift will be honored with the coveted Artist of the Decade award at the 2019 American Music Awards ceremony; Britney Spears is giving devoted followers the ultimate fan experience with a Los Angeles pop-up and retail shop celebrating the pop star's iconic career opening in January 2020.\nScooter Braun  is allegedly unhappy with the way his business partner Scott Borchetta has handled their ongoing public schism with   Taylor Swift , according to a new report by  E! News .\n\"Scooter is frustrated because his name is being dragged in the mud,\" an insider told the outlet on Monday. \"He doesn't run Big Machine or have operational control of [the] company. He hasn't taken part in these negotiations.\"\nIn the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record label, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 – who reps the likes of Justin Beiber, Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande – has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29, however the “Bad Blood” songstress allegedly hasn’t been returning Braun’s calls, the source further claimed to the outlet.\nScooter Braun and Scott Borchetta pose for a photo at a private residence on June 28, 2019 in Montecito, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Ithaca Holdings)\n\"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider added of the continuing spat .\nOn Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it possible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards after Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned company of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own the master recordings, at the AMAs\nThe statement, which was obtained by  Variety , claimed that Big Machine and Dick Clark Productions had “come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platform.” The agreement maintained that it would not only cover Swift’s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\n\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed,” the statement continued.\nHowever, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to an agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that it had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\nBraun’s Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group, home to Swift’s first six albums, including the Grammy winners for album of the year, 2008’s “Fearless” and 2014’s “1989.” (Photos by Richard Shotwell, left, and Mark Von Holden/Invision/AP)\n“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the production company said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone . “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”\nOn Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big Machine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has been working on where her music was to be used.\nThe company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its website.\n\"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her tumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read. \"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.\"\n\"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward.\n\"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,\" the statement concluded.\nSwift's rep told Fox News that this, too, was not the whole truth. \"Big Machine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them but, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes Taylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"\nA rep for Braun did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.\nFox News’ Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.",

        "articleBody": "If you’re like me and you don’t follow football throughout the season, you can always find something to love about game day — whether it’s rooting for the underdog, enjoying the halftime show and commercials, or just having a good time with friends and family.\nAs co-creator of the weight-loss program  2B Mindset , I want to help you enjoy everything about game day, including those delicious snacks!\nFootball food is “ comfort food ” — pizza, wings, chips, dips, and subs — and they can be very hard to resist.\nBut it’s important to remember that we’re fueling our bodies to watch football, not actually play it!\n5 Tips to Enjoy Game D ay Parties While Staying on Track With Your Weight-Loss Goals:\n1. Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\nI know — it all looks so good. But you can’t eat it all, so it’s time to set priorities.\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks — those that are vegetable-based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so you’re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\nAnd you don’t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just can’t live without and leave it at that.\n2. Don’t forget to drink water\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if you’re drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because they’re there.\n3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we’re feeling especially hungry.\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\nThat’s especially true when you’re watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there — and without realizing it, you’ve consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying your food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you’re eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you don’t overdo it.\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don’t let your fingers do the walking.\n4. “Veggie-fy” your chips ‘n’ dip\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip.\nBut instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a vegetable instead.\nBecause let’s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that it’s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips .\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and you’ll see that you’ll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\nAnd don’t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip — those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\nHealthy Game Day Dip:  Mix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories.\nEnjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you’ll get plenty of tangy crunch — without all the calories.\n5. Go topless (with your sub)\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you’re saving nearly 100 calories — about the same as a bottle of light beer.\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats?\nThis is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself “no.” That’s why I always tell my clients: “An open face is a happy face!”\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you’re out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks — without overdoing it!",

Here’s why:\nThere’s a strange disconnect in the online business world.\nOnline business owners tend to be introverts.\nI mean, really … it’s the perfect job for an introvert!\nYou can do your work all by yourself without needing to interact with a single person in real life. Your computer screen provides comfort and cover from the world outside your doors.\nAnd despite the fact that you’re working alone, your business can flourish.\nBut here’s the disconnect …\nTo really grow an online business, you have to be willing to step into the limelight and claim your authority.\nYou have to be willing to be a leader .\nWelcome to a discussion about online leadership — and how to embrace it\nToday, we’re going to talk about how to adapt a success mindset so you’re able to step into a leadership role in your online business naturally and with ease.\nBut more importantly, I’m going to show you how taking a leadership role will help you to create a business you’ll love — a business that may not look like anyone else’s, but that suits you 100%.\nHere’s why stepping into an online leadership role is crucial\n“Pamela, why are we talking about leadership?”\nI’ve been thinking about leadership a lot this year. I’ve realized that it’s an essential ingredient of online success that needs to be addressed.\nThe sooner you embrace your online leader role, the sooner you’ll enjoy these benefits: You’ll feel poised and self-assured while doing all the promotional activities that come with owning an online business. You’ll become  comfortable being visible online in everything from a published blog post; an email inbox; a webinar; a live video; a podcast; a stage; and inside the pages of a book. Your business will grow, because the online world rewards people who confidently stand behind and in front of their businesses.\nI’m about to show you a path forward that even the most introverted among us can walk. It’s a way to gradually shift your success mindset so it includes opportunities to be the online leader your business needs.\nIf you … Want to share your expertise with the world — but you’re secretly terrified to “put yourself out there” Feel a deep desire to build a business that makes a difference but aren’t sure what it’s going to take Wish you had tens of thousands of people in your audience — but are intimidated by those numbers at the same time\n… keep reading. I’m about to show you how to become an online business leader naturally and with less stress and fear.\nHow a success mindset helps you triumph online\nThis is the second article in a series about how to build an online business you’ll love.\nIn the first article , I talked about how online businesses are built in predictable stages.\nI shared a quiz that helps you pinpoint the stage you’re in now.\nThe BIG benefit of knowing your business-building stage?\nIt allows you to focus all your efforts on reaching the important milestones in that stage … and gives you permission to ignore the stages you’re not in right now.\nSay goodbye to that feeling of overwhelm you’ve been carrying around!\nToday, I’m going to build on what I shared in the first article by showing you how to shift your “success mindset” toward growth. I’m going to map out an easy path to becoming the online leader your business needs.\nI don’t see anyone else online talking about this, so today I’m breaking the silence!\nI think you’ll like what you’re about to learn. There’s a way to do this that’s not stressful and that builds naturally from one experience to another.\nMy goal with this article is to show you a way to become more comfortable standing both behind and in front of the online business you’re building. Ready?\nHave you experienced these “moments of personal growth?”\nAny time you’re building a business — online or offline — you’re going to experience some moments that cause you to … well, let’s say they cause you to grow as a person.\nThat’s putting a pleasant spin on it, isn’t it?\nMaybe you’ve experienced these moments before: You’re putting together a first offer and then it hits you — “Oh, if I want people to buy this, I have to market it … not just now, but forever!” You know that in order to reach prospects you’ve got to extend yourself.  But yikes … outreach is so uncomfortable! You’re given opportunities to be more visible — maybe it’s an interview request or a small speaking gig — and you’re terrified to say “yes.”\nIf you’ve experienced any of these challenging moments, guess what? You’re normal! And they help to form your success mindset.\nBut if you stay stuck in these moments and don’t move beyond them, your business won’t become what it can be.\nYour introverted side will stay cozy and comfortable, that’s for sure.\nBut you will always wonder, “What would have happened if I’d experienced the momentary discomfort and pushed past it?”\nThat’s what we’re going to cover here: a way to embrace a success mindset and push beyond the momentary discomfort so you can experience everything that’s waiting for you on the other side.\nBeware the deep end\nBefore we dive in, let’s talk about the deep end for a moment.\nThere are a lot of people online who are pushing their solutions for gaining visibility in your online business. They’re selling: Courses on writing a book Workshops on becoming a highly paid speaker Classes on running successful webinars\nThese are all good things.  They’re all things I’ve done myself! But if you take courses on doing these “deep end” things before you’ve done some of the “shallow end” things I’m about to share, you may end up feeling intimidated — not inspired.\nAnd sadly, you may never take the first steps.\nThat’s what I’m about to cover …  the first steps.  They’re crucial!\nRead on for three tips that will help you build a firm foundation for online leadership so that courses like the ones above feel like a natural next step.\n1. Start small and recognize that no one is watching\nHere’s an analogy:\nWhen you’re in the planning and in the early building stages of your online businesses — planning your website and offers, and building the first-draft versions of both — there’s a helpful way to think about what you’re doing.\nImagine you’re in an auditorium in the backstage area, and the curtains are drawn. No one in the audience can see what you’re doing back there!\nYou’re planning and building what you’ll reveal to the world — but you haven’t pulled back the curtains and invited them in.\nHere’s what I want you to remember …\nWhen you do finally pull back those curtains with your heart in your throat and sweat beading on your upper lip?\nNo one is watching.\nI mean, if you’re lucky a few family members and friends are in your audience in the early days. But for the most part? There’s almost no one there.\nIt’s the perfect time to explore making yourself more visible. With fewer people watching your first visibility attempts, you won’t feel as intimidated by the process.\nSo start small and experiment! More on ways to experiment in the next section …\n2. Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1\nA few years ago, I was honored to be asked to speak twice at Darren Rowse’s Problogger conference in Australia. The topic of one of my presentations was creating online “events” that build your audience.\nIn that presentation I talked about how the online world gives you many opportunities to step out of your comfort zone.\nAnd I used this highly scientific graphic to illustrate the idea:\nIt got a good laugh! And I made my point, which is …\nIt’s smart to start with less-intimidating things and work your way up to the more intimidating things.\nEveryone’s list will be different. For me, the online visibility spectrum used to look like this:\nNOT SCARY Writing a blog post Writing a piece of email marketing Speaking to someone on the phone\nTERROR LEVEL 100 Delivering the keynote speech at a conference Hosting a live video on a social media platform Publishing and promoting a book\nHere’s the thing:\nI didn’t go from the Non-scary stuff to the Terror Level 100 list.\nInstead, I moved from the Non-scary to the Kind of Scary stuff. I mastered the Kind of Scary list and moved on to the Intimidating list. I got comfortable with the  Intimidating list and found myself ready to tackle the Terror Level 100 list.\nAll the while, my visibility increased. My success mindset became more resilient.\nAs you push into your next level of discomfort, you’ll find yourself being asked to participate in highly visible online events. People will ask you to write blog posts for them; appear on their podcasts; deliver the keynote addresses at their conferences.\nThe good news?\nYou’ll have a strong success mindset and you’ll be ready for it all.\n3. Get support for the scary stuff to strengthen your success mindset\nWe already talked about how introverts can thrive online.\nWe sit alone at our screens, crafting information and messages that reach across the world and draw an audience to us … without having to leave the comfort of our homes, if we don’t want to.\nBut sitting in comfort stops you from growing into an online leadership role that will benefit you and your business.\nWhen it comes to moving yourself along the “visibility spectrum” toward a leadership role, it’s incredibly helpful to have a group of supportive colleagues by your side. People who share your dreams; empathize with your frustrations; and are generous with their support.\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve reached out to colleagues and said something along the lines of …\n“Argh! I know I need to do this but it’s scary!”\nHaving a team of people around you that you can be “real” with is vital if you want to move yourself along that visibility spectrum.\nHere’s how to switch up your success mindset and become the online leader your business needs\nLet’s quickly recap what we covered in this article: Start small and recognize that no one is watching. The early days are the perfect time to explore things that feel uncomfortable — your audience is small and you won’t feel as intimidated. Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1 . Remember, online leadership and authoritative visibility exist on a spectrum. Move along it step-by-step and your confidence will grow naturally. Get support for the scary stuff. If you are truly committed to growth, consider joining a group where the other members will have your back and offer support when you’re about to take a big, scary step.\n“Become an online leader” sounds like a tall order. But it doesn’t have to be! Take it step-by-step and get support for the hard parts and you’ll get there before you know it.\nShare this information, please?\nA favor: would you take a moment to share this information?\nAs I said earlier, I don’t see anyone else talking about how building up to an online leadership role will grow your business — and how to do it with less stress.\nI’d really love to get this information out to more people, so if you can take a moment to share, I’d appreciate it.\nComing next: how to make Plan & Grow BIG work for your business\nIn the final article in this series, we’re going to dig deep into how the Plan & Grow BIG approach to building an online business really works — and how to put it to use in your business.\nIt’s all about finding your starting point and focusing on the milestones that are just ahead. If you’re just starting out, I’ll show you the path to take to get your online business off to a great start. If you’ve already built your online business but it hasn’t reached its full potential, you’ll discover some new ideas for skyrocketing your growth.\nGo forth and lead\nNow you know a natural progression you can use to step into an online leadership role that will grow your reach and your revenues.\nIf you’re ready to build and grow your online business, check out the BIG League — my self-paced program for online business builders — and download the Online Business Success Roadmap .",

        "articleBody": "At the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\n\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\nNow consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.\nSo, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the past.\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein.\n\"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\nIf it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had! Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"\nSo, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n(Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's health an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen feeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)\nGiven that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White House is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\n\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\nThis -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should you.",

        "articleBody": "The road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes time and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there . In general, here are the steps you can take:\nHow to retire early\n1. Define early retirement\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live — i.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n2. Take inventory\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the  Physician on FIRE , retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances . \n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should  calculate your net worth . This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your  annual spending . You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n3. Establish your target number\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality. \nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \" Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need ,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal — and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n4. Live below your means\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE . LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\n5. Leverage your income\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income , he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term solution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income , such as real estate , he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n6. Max out your retirement accounts\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return.\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA , which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings — tax-free, at any time.\n7. Invest the money that's left over\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds . Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\n8. If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it , while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\nTommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post . One of his biggest regrets ? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n9. Research your options for health insurance\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA ; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\n10. Make a backup plan\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank , taking your net worth with it — would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line. \n11. Put Plan A into action — but enjoy the present, too\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you can.\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire , \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not all we do, either. It is important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those smaller achievements.\"\nRelated coverage in Investing :\nTanza is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ and former correspondent for Personal Finance Insider.

        "articleBody": "Средняя суточная калорийность 1694 Ккал.\nДиета Аткинса является двухфазной - в первую фазу, продолжительность которой 14 дней, ваш организм будет получать минимально необходимое количество углеводов - что позволит выравнивать баланс калорий за счет расходования внутренних ресурсов из жировых отложений - максимальное снижение веса. По истечении 14 дней ограничение на калорийность продуктов снимается, но остается ограничение на количество углеводов - в этом сложность диеты - максимальное значение определяется индивидуально исходя из особенностей вашего организма - постоянный контроль веса и коррекция баланса углеводов практически на протяжении всей жизни.\nНа протяжении двух первых недель количество углеводов не должно превышать 20 грамм в сутки. Среднее значение этого параметра для большинства людей составляет около 40 граммов (превышение приведет к ожирению - что и имеет место быть для большинства людей с избыточным весом - потребляемые одновременно углеводы и жиры не усваиваются одинаково - углеводы как энергетический источник полностью расходуются на поддержание сегодняшних потребностей, а часть жиров запасается - если имел место быть их излишек - наш организм только их и способен запасать - такова наша физиология).\nЦифра в 20 грамм легко достижима - это всего-навсего 3 чайных ложки сахарного песка в чай или сдобная булочка - поэтому никакого быстрого питания и перекусов. Для предотвращения таких ситуаций составлен список разрешенных всегда и в любом количестве (условно) продуктов - понятно, что подразумевается ваша инициативность - никаких излишеств - кушаем только тогда, когда появилось устойчивое чувство голода - никаких чипсов за сериалами.\nПить можно и обычную, и минеральную воду, и чай, и кофе, и Coca-Cola Light - любой напиток без углеводов (например, стакан виноградного сока содержит почти 30 грамм углеводов - а это явный перебор суточной нормы).\nВторая фаза диеты Аткинса",

        "articleBody": "One of the top-performing beauty stocks could surge after 'Kylie Jenner' makeover\nPublished Tue, Nov 19 2019 7:05 AM EST Updated Tue, Nov 19 2019 7:16 AM EST\nBeauty company Coty is breaking out — in a good way.\nThe stock added more than 2% to begin the week after the beauty brand took a majority stake in Kylie Jenner's cosmetics company in a deal worth $600 million. Those gains add to a major gain for shares, climbing more than 80% so far this year.\nMatt Maley , equity strategist at Miller Tabak, says the stock could be a risky bet with a worthy reward.\n\"This is a stock that until this year had been getting clobbered,\" Maley said on CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" on Monday. \"It was down for four straight years, down well over 60%, and the rally has only just recently broken above that multiyear trend line. If it can take it a little bit further and break above $13.60, that will follow that upward break of the trend line with a very nice higher high and will confirm that its long-term trend has broken to the upside.\"\n\"A little bit more risk but more reward because whenever you buy any stock in the early stages of a change in trend, it always gives you a little more upside potential,\" Maley said.\nThe Coty-Kylie Jenner deal could be the beginning of a new trend for consumer-facing stocks, says John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.\n\"Here's a company that's willing to pay for the eyeballs and the followers that Kylie Jenner has more so than anything else. So, this could be a new paradigm for the consumer staples, packaged goods industry which, you know, has been suffering because of weak mall traffic and the rise of e-commerce because shelf space has basically become infinite,\" Petrides said during the same segment.\nCoty acquired a 51% ownership position in Jenner's beauty and cosmetics portfolio, a deal announced at the beginning of the week. Jenner still has a partnership with Ulta Beauty to sell her products in its stores. That relationship began last November and led to several quarters of revenue growth for Ulta.\n\"I would expect more acquisitions like this going forward because it could be the new model for companies to acquire top-line growth by partnering up with key influencers,\" Petrides said.",

        "articleBody": "Ever since I read Dune , I’ve kept a quote from it close to my heart, tucked away for times when I needed it most. If you’ve read the book, you probably know it as well. It’s the Bene Gesserit litany against fear, and part of what Paul Atreides learned on his way to becoming a hero.\n“ I must not fear,” it begins. “Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”\nThat quote has given me comfort for a long time. At times, I’ve used it to visualize myself standing in a sea of turmoil, solid and immovable, while the flames of fear scour the land around me. In moments of stress and conflict, anxiety and panic, it has been a balm for rattled nerves and failing resolve.\nPolygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games. When we award a game the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the title is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want to see the very best of the best for your platform(s) of choice, check out Polygon Essentials .\nBut I realize now that there is another kind of fear. That kind of fear lives inside of you. That kind of fear can become like a poison in the mind and of the spirit. It is self doubt. It is worry. It is remorse and regret. It is so many things that can’t be washed away by standing still and finding calm.\nIt’s the kind of fear that stops you from simply doing anything.\nEventually, the flock of birds that plagues you will coalesce into a massive, shrieking demon. Nomada Studio/Devolver Digital\nGris is a game that wants to teach us something about these fears we hold inside. It does so with a beautiful art style, a moving soundscape, and gameplay that, at times, flashes over into metaphor.\nIn Gris , you play as a woman (also named Gris) who has lost her voice and, with it, her agency. Her fears and her pain initially take the shape of a flock of birds that works to harass and punish her. She begins the game terribly weak, unable to even put one foot in front of the other. By the end, though, she’s become incredibly mobile and skilled. Hers is a journey to reclaim an intangible, inner kind of power. It is a journey toward rediscovering the self, and toward peace.\nGris is one of the most beautiful games that I’ve ever played. The art style is rendered as smooth, seemingly hand-painted watercolors that are light and airy on the screen when the game begins. By the end, however, Gris is awash with vivid color and movement. The art is not static like the technique used in Valkyria Chronicles . Instead, it works in layers of pattern and shape that become more complex over time. The art expands its depth as well, playing with parallax elements that both surprise and delight.\nThe gameplay as well grows and evolves, adding on little flourishes to its animations as new mechanics are introduced. So much of those mechanics are vital to the storyline itself, so I’m hesitant to spoil them all here. But let’s take just one as an example.\nLike the protagonist in Dune , your avatar first learns to become like a stone, standing firm against violent winds that will push you across the screen. If you’ve seen promotional art or trailers for the game , you’ve likely seen the main character flounce her dress up into a cube to weather these storms. It looks silly in still images, but in motion, the mechanic works well. There is weight to it, but also intentionality. Once you’ve learned to use that shape to survive cruel winds, then you’ll learn to harness those same winds to move forward.\nThe sound design in Gris is full of little surprises. In one scene you’ll swim through a rain storm. Dive underwater and the timbre of the sound changes to match. Meanwhile, the sound of rain itself falls away. Nomada Studio/Devolver Digital\nOnly by embracing those winds that have held her back is Gris able to reach new heights. What was once an obstacle becomes a resource, propelling you forward in the game. The analogy works as well visually as it does mechanically.\nGris is simply packed with little details like that, tiny things that, when considered, blossom into meaning. There’s a powerful feedback loop at play there as well. Even as I noticed more about the game’s symbols, I began to look for them in everything I touched. The environments themselves call out to the player, inviting them to pause and reflect on pain and loss and how to move on toward fulfillment and peace. You’re not simply moving through the environment, either. It reacts to you, welcomes you, and empowers you to think cleverly about solutions.\nGris will only take you a handful of hours to play from start to finish, but I can’t recommend it strongly enough. I only wish the experience lasted longer.\nDeveloped by Nomada Studio and published by Devolver Digital, Gris is set to be released on Dec. 13 for Nintendo Switch and Windows PC.",

        "articleBody": "Il avait été condamné deux fois à la perpétuité pour plusieurs assassinats. Le tueur en série Michel Fourniret, surnommé « l’ogre des Ardennes », est mort lundi 10 mai à l’âge de 79 ans, a annoncé le procureur de Paris, Rémy Heitz, à l’Agence France-Presse (AFP).\nIl « est mort lundi à 15 heures à l’unité hospitalière sécurisée interrégionale (UHSI) de la Pitié-Salpétrière à Paris » , a précisé Rémy Heitz. Michel Fourniret, qui souffrait de problèmes cardiaques et de la maladie d’Alzheimer, était hospitalisé depuis le 28 avril dans cette unité dépendante du centre pénitentiaire de Fresnes. « Une enquête a été ouverte pour “ recherches des causes de la mort ” , confiée au 3 e  district de police judiciaire » , a ajouté le procureur. Cette ouverture d’enquête est une pratique systématique en cas de décès en milieu pénitentiaire, et une autopsie doit être pratiquée dans ce cadre, selon une source proche du dossier.\nSérie de meurtres\nNé le 4 avril 1942 à Sedan (Ardennes), Michel Fourniret, marié trois fois et père de cinq enfants, se serait peu à peu transformé en prédateur sexuel après avoir découvert que sa première épouse n’était pas vierge. De son propre aveu, l’ajusteur et dessinateur en mécanique, père de famille discret le jour, se serait alors mué en « braconnier » à ses heures sombres.\nIl est d’abord condamné à trois reprises, en 1967, 1984 et 1987, pour une douzaine d’agressions sexuelles.

        "articleBody": "Close ESPN.com senior writer Author of \"License to Deal\" Former Denver Post national baseball writer\nAs Major League Baseball's competition committee debates the impact of defensive shifts, lots of people have theories on why hitters have been slow to adjust and are falling into a depressed, statistically impaired state as hot shots to the right side routinely result in outs.\nEditor's Picks\nThe list of interested bystanders includes commissioner Rob Manfred, who recently observed that hitters haven't adapted to the challenge in the manner baseball had anticipated.\n\"It was common thought, 'People are going to learn just to go the other way,''' Manfred told reporters at the MLB owners meetings in June. \"But the fact of the matter is the human element took over, and what they decided to do was go over the top rather than go the other way.''\nAgent Scott Boras has labeled shifts \"discriminatory'' to left-handed hitters. Come November, when Bryce Harper files for free agency, Boras will have a better idea of whether teams in the market for a nine-figure, power-hitting corner outfielder share that opinion.\nAre hitters simply too stubborn to adjust, or are the answers more complex? The potential hazards of a hitter going outside his comfort zone to beat the shift were evident during a recent Nationals-Blue Jays game, when Washington's Matt Adams suffered a broken finger while squaring to bunt against a vacant left side of the infield. As hitters also can attest, teams routinely pitch to the shift. A pitcher is not going to throw soft stuff away to a left-handed hitter with the entire left side of the infield uninhabited.\nESPN.com recently asked three lefty hitters who face varying percentages of shifts for their takes on the state of affairs. How do they try to attack defensive shifts, and do they think MLB can take any steps to address the problem -- if there is, indeed, a problem?\nDaniel Murphy , Nationals Daniel Murphy has missed more than half of the Nationals' games this season, highlighting Washington's injury issues.  Rob Carr/Getty Images\n(Murphy was out until June because of knee surgery. He went 3-for-9 against the shift in his first 22 games this season.)\n\"Strikeouts are way up, so getting a base hit is more difficult than ever because of the velocity and how good pitchers are now. You see velocity and secondary weapons for four or five at-bats a game.\n\"It's really difficult to get three hits in one inning. If you hit three singles, it's one run. If you get a walk and a double, you might get one run. If you get a double and a single, you might get one run. So my goal is to touch second base every single time I step to home plate. If I'm not mistaken, somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 percent of ground balls go for extra-base hits. If I want to touch second base, I'm not going to be able to hit the ball on the ground. Pulled ground balls are not really base hits in this league anymore. \"When baseball started, they set players up in the positions they did because that's where they thought the ball was going to be hit. You had the first baseman and the third basemen at the corners, the middle infielders and three outfielders. There was no rule that you had to have five guys on the dirt, a catcher and three outfielders. They just set it up that way because they said, 'Hey, this is where we think we're going to hit the ball.' It's the same thing that's being done now.\"\nDaniel Murphy\n\"I haven't really stolen bases for five or six years. If I drop a bunt down, what am I gonna do? I'm stuck at first base, so what I've done is ask our ballclub to get two more singles, or I've asked someone else to hit a double. If 7 percent of balls on the ground go for extra bases, someone is probably going to have to hit one in the air to score me from first. So what I've tried to do is hit a double every single time because it's really difficult to get three hits.\n\"If I'm not mistaken, the level of production goes: strikeout, popup, ground ball, fly ball, line drive. The production comes mostly from fly balls and line drives, so that's what we want. I'm trying to hit a line drive first. And if I miss, I hit a fly ball. Ground balls, popups and strikeouts aren't going to give you anything. It's not necessarily rocket science.\n\"I'm not trying to hit it in one specific place. If I look up, and they're full-shifting me, and I only have one defender in the 5-6 hole where the third baseman plays, I have to let the ball get a little deeper. But the pitchers are pretty good, and that's now a foul ball. I'm really never in the business of trying to aim for a certain area because I have to be perfect, and I'm not perfect.\n\"If any of us could control hits, we would get more of them. But you can't. You can only control the process.\nDefensive Runs Saved due to shifts\nMost Fewest Rays, 24 Phillies, -9 Yankees, 23 Pirates, -1 Diamondbacks, 21 Nationals, 0 Royals, 19\n\"When baseball started, they set players up in the positions they did because that's where they thought the ball was going to be hit. You had the first baseman and the third basemen at the corners, the middle infielders and three outfielders. There was no rule that you had to have five guys on the dirt, a catcher and three outfielders. They just set it up that way because they said, 'Hey, this is where we think we're going to hit the ball.' It's the same thing that's being done now.\n\"The question everybody has to ask themselves is, 'Why are we playing the game? What is the goal of the game?' I think it's to score more runs than the other team. That seems to be what organizations are trying to do. They're going to set guys up there because they think, 'This is going to help us prevent runs' and 'We're going to try and attack the baseball in this way because we think it's going to help us score runs.' That's the name of the game. I think this has been a long time in the making. It's actually been quite impressive to watch how quickly teams have adapted to the data they've got.\n\"The reason they shift you in the places they do is because that's what your batted ball data says. I heard Joe Maddon say, 'You have three choices: You can try to hit it and beat the shift. That's going to give you a single, but now you're doing something against what you're best at, so the defense wins. You can hit into the shift, and the defense wins. Or you can try not to let the infielders catch the batted ball. No ground balls and no popups. Try to stand on second base.' That's Option C.''\nKyle Seager , Mariners Jennifer Buchanan-USA TODAY Sports\n(Seager has been shifted against 69.4 percent of the time this season, according to Baseball Savant. That's the 13th-highest rate in baseball. He's hitting .235 against the shift.)\n\"It happens so many times now, where a ball would have been in the 4-hole [between first and second base], but that isn't there anymore. Or you hit a line drive up the middle, and the guy is standing there. It's kind of the new norm.\n\"When I debuted in 2011, shifts were nonexistent. Now when they play you straight up, it almost looks strange out there. That's another reason why guys are trying to get the ball in the air. Ground balls through the infield aren't getting through now. The people upstairs who are putting players in these positions are smart. They know all the numbers, and there's obviously a reason why they do it. \"If you're facing David Ortiz, and he bunts over there and gets a single, he may have just done us a favor. If we let Ortiz beat us with a bunt as opposed to him hitting a homer, maybe that's OK.\"\nKyle Seager\n\"I used to try to manipulate my swing to hit balls to the left side of the infield and create some easy hits. I'll still try to do it at times, depending on where guys are positioned, but a lot goes into it. It depends on the situation in the game. How many outs are there? Are there runners on base? If there are two outs and I get into a 2-0 count and I hit a little ground ball to the shortstop hole, that probably wasn't as productive a team at-bat as it could have been if I ended up hitting a double somewhere.\n\"I've tried to bunt a few times, and I've had a few successes. But the third baseman is usually still in there for the first two strikes, so the bunt is not as big a factor as it could be. Again, it's dictated by the score and the situation in the game.\n\"It goes back to the question of 'How can I help the team the most?' Am I going to help the team the most over the course of the season hitting weak ground balls to shortstop [for a single]? I'm not a guy who steals a bunch of bases, so you're relying on a few hits to score me. If I try to drive the ball and I hit a double, it only takes one hit to score me. I definitely understand how people can look at it and say, 'Man, just hit a ball to the left side.' But there are a lot of different arguments to it.\n\"We've had meetings and talked about this stuff. If you're facing David Ortiz, and he bunts over there and gets a single, he may have just done us a favor. If we let Ortiz beat us with a bunt as opposed to him hitting a homer, maybe that's OK.\n\"As far as baseball doing something to change the shifts, that's for people smarter than me to decide. I just go out there and play where they tell me to play.''\nMatt Carpenter , Cardinals David Kohl-USA TODAY Sports\n(Carpenter been shifted against 295 times this season -- fifth-most in the majors behind Chris Davis , Joey Gallo , Justin Smoak and Curtis Granderson . He's batting .270 vs. shifts.)\n\"Think about which hitters teams shift against. They shift on guys who drive the ball. By trying to hit a ground ball to short -- which is the one spot on the infield where you would be able to beat the shift -- that's exactly what they want you to do.\n\"There's this whole narrative of 'Why don't guys just hit ground balls to short?' The answer is: (a) It's not that easy and (b) it's the complete thing you've taught yourself your entire baseball career to avoid. If a guy has a chance to hit a homer and a double, and he goes up there trying to slap a ground ball to short, the other team is perfectly fine with that.\n\"I think it gets blown out of proportion when people say, 'Just hit a ground ball to short.' You can't just take a 98 mph cutting fastball in on your hands and do that. Let's just say I sell out tonight, and I try it four times. The likelihood of me hitting four straight ground balls to short and ending up 4-for-4 are very slim. If I succeed once or maybe twice, at best I'm going to go 2-for-4 with two singles, where if I just play the game, I might go 2-for-4 with a homer and a double. It makes no sense to me.\n\"Just think about this: When there's a runner on third base and less than two outs and the infield is playing back, every hitter in baseball knows that all you have to do is hit a ground ball anywhere, and you score the run. And that success rate is still super small. That play is easy, and it gets screwed up all the time. Guys can't hit a ground ball when all they have to do is hit a ground ball to score a run.\n\"As defenders, when a guy comes up and hits a ground ball to short [to beat the shift], we still go to the same place the next time. It doesn't change anything. You look at the guys they shift on, and they're paid to drive the ball. People aren't doing it against Billy Hamilton and guys like that. \"I think it gets blown out of proportion when people say, 'Just hit a ground ball to short.' You can't just take a 98 mph cutting fastball in on your hands and do that. Let's just say I sell out tonight, and I try it four times. The likelihood of me hitting four straight ground balls to short and ending up 4-for-4 are very slim. If I succeed once or maybe twice, at best I'm going to go 2-for-4 with two singles, where if I just play the game, I might go 2-for-4 with a homer and a double.\"\nMatt Carpenter\n\"When you look at where we're headed in baseball, the one alarming thing is the number of balls that are put in play. It's hard now -- period. Everyone is throwing 95 mph-plus with movement. Every bullpen has guys out there doing that. So just putting the ball in play and not striking out is a challenge in itself. If you already have all these disadvantages against the hitting side of the game, I wouldn't be opposed to getting back to playing the game the way it was always played, where you have two guys on the left side of the infield and two guys on the right side of the infield.\n\"I think the easiest way to do it would be for guys to play where they've played for all the time the game has been around. Two guys on the left side. Two guys on the right side. You have a designated area where the shortstop, third baseman, second baseman and first baseman all go, and you play there. That would be the simplest way. Is it gonna happen? I don't know. But if you're looking to help even out the advantage that pitchers have over the hitters, that's the only way to do it.''

Thankfully, it seems to be contained to one store — at least 703 of those illnesses are from people who ate at a single location in Powell, OH (9733 Sawmill Parkway).\nPer the Dayton newspaper, the source of the outbreak has not yet been identified, and tests for Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli and Norovirus have come back negative. A recent health inspection did find that the black beans and pinto beans weren't kept at a high enough temperature and lettuce was not properly refrigerated after preparation. However, both violations were said to be corrected that day.\nThis content is imported from Twitter.

The Powell restaurant was immediately closed once illnesses were discovered, CBS News reports, with employees following Chipotle's food safety protocol, which includes replacing food and cleaning the restaurant.\nSo far, at least two lawsuits have been brought against Chipotle related to the Ohio outbreak. Attorney Ron Simon, who represents one person still receiving medical treatment after eating food at the restaurant, told the paper this: \"This is the first of many lawsuits we will be filing on behalf of local residents who were sickened by contaminated Chipotle food. We have handled hundreds of claims against Chipotle as this is Chipotle’s seventh food poisoning outbreak in the last 3 years.\"\nDelish , who reported this story, reached out to Chipotle for comment on the situation.

        "articleBody": "ロレックスが1926年に開発した防水・防塵腕時計、オイスター。世界で初めて腕時計に防水性を備え、精度を飛躍的に上げたこの機構は、誕生から90年を経た今なおロレックスの時計はもちろん、ほぼ全ての機械式時計に影響を与え続けている。今回は、そんなロレックス オイスターにフォーカスして、歴史や魅力を紹介！\nスポンサーリンク\nロレックスは、設立当初から精度を最優先にして時計を開発するメーカーだった。創業から5年後の1910年、腕時計として初めて公式な精度証明であるクロノメーター認定を獲得。スイスクロノメーター歩度公認検定局より与えられるこの認定は、腕時計が当時の基準であった懐中時計と同じくらい精確であるということを初めて証明したのである。1914年には、当時クロノメーター精度の最高の権威であったイギリスのキュー天文台からロレックスの腕時計にA級証明書が与えられ、時計製造の世界に衝撃を与えた。45日にも及ぶ非常に厳しい検査を経なければならないこの認定は、それまでは基本的に大型の航海用クロノメーターのためのものだったからである。こうしてロレックスは、当時ほとんど誰も信じなかった、腕時計が他のどのタイプよりも精度の高さで負けないことを示したのだ。\n初のA級証明書(1914年)\nロレックス登場以前の腕時計は、精度が低く特に女性用の装飾品と考えられていた。また、当時の時計技術者達の間では、腕時計の耐久性と精密性は両立できないだろうとも言われていた時代だ。そんな中、創業者のハンス・ウィルスドルフは、精度の問題をクリアした「埃や汗や水、熱や寒さから永遠に守られることを保証できる防水性能を備えたケース」の製造に取り掛かる。そして1926年、「オイスター」を開発したのである。\n腕時計の信頼性と精度を抜本的に向上さたロレックス オイスターは時計製造の歴史において画期的なことだった。当時のオイスターの革新性は、ハンス・ウィルスドルフ本人の言葉でリアルに残されている。オイスター発表から数ヶ月後の1927年1月、集まった時計販売業者たちを前に「我が社が作っているのは世界最高の腕時計だ。」と高らかに宣言。そして「オイスターは、近年において腕時計に関する最も重要な発明であると考えている。」と断言した。ブランド設立当初は、スイスではなくロンドンに拠点を置いていたロレックス。創業からわずか20年ほどのあいだに、「イギリスの市場向けに、すべてのスイスの時計製造会社を合わせたよりも多くの人気モデルを製造した」と公表できるほどに成長したのである。\n防水ケースで守られていたとはいえ、初代オイスターにはまだ弱点がひとつあった。当時の機械式腕時計は、時計を動かすためのエネルギーを供給するために手で巻き上げるのが必須。これは防水性のリューズを緩めなければならないということを意味し、時計の外と内を隔てる障壁が破られ、湿気や汚れが侵入する可能性があったのだ。オイスターのコンセプトを完成させムーブメントを真の密閉状態にするには、これを避け、外部のエネルギーの助けを借りずにムーブメントが自動的に巻き上げられるようにする方法を考案するのが不可欠。懐中時計では18世紀の時点で確立されていた自動巻き機構だが、腕時計では満足のいくものは存在しなかった。ハンス・ウィルスドルフはこの難題に取り組み、数年間の研究を重ねる。そして1931年、ロレックスは「パーペチュアル」と呼ばれる自由に回転するローターを備えた自動巻き機構に対する一連の特許を登録。これはのちに時計産業全体で採用される規格となり、手首の動きによってメインスプリングと噛み合ったローターが回転し、時計を着けたままで、ゼンマイが巻かれるようになったのだ。\n世界初の腕時計用の防水ケースとして、腕時計製造史の大きなターニングポイントを与えたオイスターケース。端正でエレガントな時計ケースは防水性と堅牢性の象徴であり、デザイン性と機能性を見事に融合させている。現行のオイスターケースは、904Lスチール、18ctゴールドまたは950プラチナ製を展開。\nケースの密閉構造によって、今日ではすべてのオイスターモデルは最低でも水深100m(330フィート)の性能を保持。そして究極のダイバーズウォッチである「ロレックス ディープシー」は3,900m(12,800フィート)までの防水性能を誇る。オイスターのミドルケース(ケースの中央部分)は904Lスチール、18ctゴールドまたはプラチナの塊から製造されている。極めて堅牢なこのミドルケースは、ケースの他の部品すべてをしっかりと固定する支柱の役割を果たす。一部のプロフェッショナルモデルでは、ミドルケースと一体となったリューズガードも装備。また、裏蓋がミドルケースにしっかりとねじ込まれているのも特徴。\nクラウンを施したロレックスウォッチを象徴するリューズは、約10個のパーツで構成。小さいながらも高度な技術が結集された傑作である。このリューズは、しっかりと時計のケースにねじ込まれ、ケースが完全に密閉されて安全な内部環境を確保。危険な外部環境からムーブメントを完璧にガードする。さらに本格的なダイバーズモデルでは、トゥインロックリューズおよびトリプロックリューズを採用。それぞれ、2重または3重密閉となっており、潜水艦のハッチのように高い防水性能を確実にする。\nフォルムと機能が結びついたベゼルも大きな特徴だ。オイスター ウォッチに独自の強い個性を与える重要な要素であるべゼルは、長年にわたり固定式や回転式などさまざまな形状のものが開発されてきた。潜水時間、第2タイムゾーン、24時間表示、タキメーターなど、時計のタイプに合わせて多彩な新機能を装備している。\nオイスターケースの特徴⑤「刻みのデザイン」\nロレックスは何十年もの間に、オイスター パーペチュアルをベースにした幅広いコレクションを開発。ひとつ一つの新しいモデルは、あらゆる環境に適した特別なニーズに対応するものだった。厳しい気候に耐え、信頼性と精度に優れる時計が装備として必要となるあらゆる局面において、スイマー、レーシングドライバー、飛行士、登山家や探検家までさまざまな人々がこの時計を着用。1945年には、創設40周年を記念して、ダイアルの3時位置の小窓に革新的な日付表示を備えた、ゴールドのオイスター パーペチュアルのデイトジャストを発表し、高い人気を博した。その後、オイスターコレクションは、2つの基軸に沿って発展していく。\nひとつは、デイトジャストや曜日と日付を表示する1956年発表のデイデイトや、カレンダー付でデュアルタイムゾーンを備えた2012年発表のスカイドゥエラーのような、エレガントなクラシックモデルである。\nオイスターコレクションのプロフェッショナルモデルである「エクスプローラー」、「サブマリーナー」、「GMT マスター」、「ヨットマスター」、「コスモグラフ デイトナ」はいずれも各分野における基準となり、探検家やパイロット、レーシングドライバーのための時計の原型となった。最初のオイスターが誕生してから90年間にわたり、創設者のヴィジョンを達成すべく卓越した技術を用いて極めて高性能な腕時計を製造している。",

        "articleBody": "Michael Stewart/FilmMagic\nThe 2018 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show is getting some big changes in the mane department courtesy of celebrity hair stylist Anthony Turner. According to the hair pro, this year’s tresses will look more natural than ever on the Angels and supermodels.\nTurner shared his inspiration for this year’s hair moment saying that with the return of the iconic fashion show to New York City, he wanted the girls to look a little more downtown and real by embracing their natural texture and length. And the theme of this year’s styling? “We’re celebrating individuality — we don’t want the girls to look like a generic army of robots. We’re celebrating each girl for who she is.”\nTo get the downtown cool look for yourself, start by applying a volumizing mousse through damp hair. Turner recommends to start with a small amount of mousse, “because you can always go back in and add more if the hair feels like it doesn’t have enough grip once we start blow drying.”\nThen, add a small amount of serum-oil to the hair, applying from the mid-length through the ends of the hair to boost shine and break up the ends, so the hair looked natural.\nNext, blow dry your strands with the InfinitiPro by Conair 3Q Electronic Brushless Motor Hair Dryer. No brushes necessary, according to Turner. “We’re not using any brushes — we’re just tossing around the hair with our hands to help the hair look somewhat separated, which emphasizes the natural look we want to achieve.” Once dry, curl your locks with an Infiniti Pro by Conair 2-in-1 Black Titanium Styler, wrapping 1-inch sections of hair around the exterior of the iron, working from back to front with care that there is an even amount of curls all the way through. Another pro tip: start each curl a few inches down from the roots so the top of the hair remains smooth.\nNext, take the interior plates of the same styler to further smooth down any flyaways at the top of the hair and bevel the front sections away from the face. Let the hair cool and rake it through with a comb — et voila! Hair that looks natural, relaxed and cool.\nFor access to all our exclusive celebrity videos and interviews – Subscribe on YouTube!",

        "articleBody": "近日，媒體Bleacher Report評選出了休賽期的前十名的簽約榜單，排名參考了合約的性價比、球員潛力。具體排名如下：\n簡評：從帳面上看，給一個 30 歲、職業生涯平均得分只有個位數的人提供 8 位數的薪水，這似乎不是最好的商業決策。但是大器晚成的Bullock——直到他的第 5 個 NBA 賽季才成為輪換陣容的常客——是一個可靠的側翼，他是個不錯的3D球員。\n簡評：Green在他的職業生涯中已經為 10 支不同的球隊效力。金塊隊給了他兩年的合約，給了他一份比老將底薪再高一點的薪水。\n簡評：當 The Athletic 的 John Hollinger 預測今年自由球員的薪水時，他預測 Nunn 的薪水將超過一年 1100 萬美元。不過湖人隊給出的兩年合約總價甚至低於1100 萬。\nNunn願意低薪加盟是因為湖人的陣容以及競爭力，Nunn是一名命中率三圍 48.5/38.1/93.3 場均得到 14.6 分的 NBA 大二球員，若是他能夠保持水準，這會是一筆超級物超所值的合約。\n根據雅虎體育的Chris Haynes的報導，邁阿密熱火隊、金州勇士隊和印第安納溜馬隊都在自由球員市場追求Batum。\n但是Batum選擇回到快艇隊，他原可以在其他球隊簽下中產合約。這位 32 歲球員簽下千萬大約的日子可能已不復返，但他仍然是一個穩定的輪替（上賽季三分球命中率為 40.4%）、他能夠組織進攻還有全面的防守。\n簡評：Portis選擇放棄追求更高的合約，與公鹿隊簽約。上賽季，他幫助密爾瓦基贏得了 50 年來的第一個 NBA 總冠軍。\n他在上賽季的積極表現，讓許多公鹿球迷成為了他的粉絲，作為比較，Kelly Olynyk獲得了一份為期三年、價值 3700 萬美元的合約，而一直飽受傷病困擾的Zach Collins以三年 2200 萬美元加盟馬刺，Portis的合約真的超佛。\n簡評：Bruce Brown是一名被低估的角色球員，在上賽季對上國王隊時他砍下29分的生涯新高。\n在這個位置概念越來越模糊的聯盟當中，Brown被譽為矮個子「中鋒」（身高 6 尺 4 寸，體重 202 磅），他總是找到方法突破防線去衝擊籃筐，他積極衝搶進攻籃板，防守也非常黏人，對於一支爭冠球隊，Brown是不可或缺的一部分。\n簡評：Patty Mills以一年約六百萬的薪資加盟籃網，所有專家都認為這是籃網總經理Sean Marks今夏最好的操作。\nMills擁有致命的三分能力（職業生涯命中率為 38.8%）、能夠帶領板凳進攻以及豐富的季後賽經驗，是馬刺隊的奪冠功臣。僅管Mills很可能會跳出的二年的合約，不過籃網要的就是能夠在新賽季角逐冠軍獎盃。\n簡評：Kemba Walker與雷霆達成買斷捨棄了2000萬美元，以平均800萬年薪加盟家鄉球隊尼克。\n31歲的他被左膝傷病困擾。上個賽季他並沒有達到 100% 的狀態，不過他仍拿下場均 19.3 分、3.0 記三分球和 4.9 次助攻。\n在風城，Ball將組織進攻，在防守端鎖定外線，並讓Zach LaVine、Nikola Vucevic和DeMar DeRozan舒服的得分，Ball有機會成為球隊核心。\n早在三月份，這位控球後衛就拒絕了湖人隊提出的為期四年、價值 8400 萬美元的續約報價。事後看來，這個決定看起來是個災難，他希望能夠簽下更高的合約，直到湖人重磅簽下Russell Wsetbrook，他才知道大事不妙。\n人們會爭論Schroder是否值 2000 萬美元的薪水。自 2016-17 賽季開始以來，他是僅有的 16 名 得分超過 6,000 分和 1,500 次助攻的球員之一，在這五個賽季中他只有 63% 的比賽擔任先發。他是一個強而有力的進攻武器，尤其是他的三分球，儘管上賽季他的三分表現不佳，但在前一個賽季他的三分命中率能達到38.5%。\n換句話說，他的價值絕對超過600萬。只是他錯過了簽下大合約的機會，他希望能在新賽季重新打出身價，相信他能做到。",

        "articleBody": "TODAY'S BEST DEALS\nTime played: 30 hours (original review)\nPlatform: PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch\nIt feels strange that Fortnite was once a long-gestating game focused on defending makeshift bases from zombies. The release of its standalone, free-to-play Battle Royale mode felt like a curio at best back in 2017, an attempt to hop onto a trend. Now, in 2019, the mode has outpaced many of its competitors, leading to footballers performing dances from the game at the World Cup final and the elderly sporting game merchandise. \nStripping back the mode's meteoric success, and in an increasingly crowded space, is Fortnite still worth parachuting into?\nFor newcomers, it’s worth a quick mention of the basic setup of a Battle Royale title - one hundred players jump onto a map, scavenging weapons and items with which to eliminate others and work to be the last player standing. Fortnite doesn't stray too far from this formula, offering solo, duo, and squad based modes, but its execution of these basics is what’s impressive...\nWe'll be continuing to update this review intermittently to assess how Fortnite's patches affect the game. \nFortnite Battle Royale: Chapter 2 update\n(Image credit: Epic Games)\nFortnite has been with us for two years and, due to its status as a ‘game as a service’, we think it’s important to update our thoughts on it. \nIn case you hadn't noticed, a lot has changed with the start of Fortnite's 11th season. For one, it's not called Season 11 - instead it carries the moniker ‘Fortnite Chapter 2’, and in many ways it does feel almost like a sequel.\nAt the end of Season 10, Fortnite's map was destroyed by a huge explosion, and swallowed by a black hole, watched by millions of players around the world. Those same millions waited days for any signs of life from Epic or the game's social accounts, and yet this period of inactivity only served to increase the hype levels - pretty impressive for a game that's already the world's most popular. It turns out that the one thing more talked about in gaming than playing Fortnite is the game being unavailable. How many games can dominate the conversation two years from launch?\nFortnite's new map will be what pulls in many lapsed players, but for our money it remains a variation on a theme. It retains the Dreamworks Animation aesthetic that has become so vaunted (and that helps it run on seemingly every platform), but the real draw here is the water.\nPreviously as deep as a puddle, water has been completely redesigned in Fortnite Chapter 2. For one, you no longer simply waltz through it as if it wasn't there. Players can swim through the water (preventing use of weaponry but potentially allowing for a sneaky getaway), while you can also use boats to traverse it. These feel much more natural to play with or against than the previously added planes and mechs, and could bring back many players that were disappointed with those additions. \n(Image credit: Epic Games)\nThere's even fishing, now, and while we have some serious concerns for the ecological state of the new map (being able to pull a shotgun or assault rifle from the bottom of a lake raises all sorts of questions about recycling), it can be a nice bonus when all you really wanted was a fish to eat for health. \nThere's more to enjoy in the map than just the water, and on land players are now able to hop into dumpsters and haystacks to surprise passing opponents. Perhaps even more excitingly, you can now use environmental hazards like exploding gas stations to deal serious damage to enemies.\nFortnite has always been at it's best when it revels in its own slapstick sensibilities, and Chapter 2 leans heavily into that. Aside from the aforementioned hiding spots, a ‘bandage bazooka’ allows for long range healing, while being able to carry comrades out of the line of fire is a neat new addition - help them up, and maybe they'll join you for a group high five (yes, there are group emotes now).\nOur favorite change for Fortnite Chapter 2, though, are the tweaks to the game's Battle Pass system. Whereas before you could go a whole match without completing one of the season's arbitrary challenges and therefore feel under-rewarded for your time, the game now offers seasonal XP and medals to help level you up just by playing the game. The challenges are still there, but those looking to just play a match without having to \"loot 10 chests\" or something like that will find the time they invest respected more.\nTo summarize, Fortnite Chapter 2 breathes fresh life into a game that's built on reinvention. It's gone from gaming phenomenon to mainstream phenomenon, and it feels like witnessing a part of history - just with more XP now.\nFortnite Battle Royale: one year on\nImage credit: Epic Games (Image credit: Epic Games)\nAs with any ever-evolving ‘live service’ game, Fortnite is constantly shifting. What started as another battle royale (albeit with building mechanics) has become a global phenomenon which is currently in the midst of its ninth season. With that in mind, we're re-evaluating Fortnite to give a more up to date perspective on the free-to-play juggernaut. \nFortnite, as we mentioned in our original review, is not only an excellent product, but one that rewards players regardless of financial investment. Someone hopping in for a handful of matches with friends will find just as much fun as someone who is grinding their way through the oft-imitated Battle Pass. All of this continues to ring true with Season 9, which offers the Gundam-esque Sentinel skin and the similarly upgradeable Rox outfit to start - and only gets more generous from there.\nEarn everything on offer, and you'll have amassed enough V-Bucks to buy your next battle pass - plus countless skins, decals, emotes and more. \nA big part of this new battle pass are Fortbytes, a new collectible that takes a little more work. Each one is numbered, and some are earned through completing battle pass challenges or earning a required amount of XP, while many can be found on the map if the player is wearing the required Battle Pass outfit. This helps Fortnite foster a rabid community that regularly works in tandem to solve mysteries - not bad for a player-versus-player title. \nImage credit: Epic Games (Image credit: Epic Games)\nOf course, a big part of such battle royale titles is the map itself and, as is tradition, Season 9 brings a wealth of changes to the bright and colorful game world. Tilted Towers has become Neo Tilted, a futuristic cityscape with a new digital clocktower and blimps flying overhead. Loot Lake's neighboring buildings are more modern now, too, while large windmills can be found dotted around Pleasant Park. Perhaps the biggest change is that of Retail Row, which was destroyed by Season 8's Volcano but now comprises a multi-level shopping mall which is perfect for ambushes and harvesting materials.\nThis is on top of new weapons which are constantly shifting and being rebalanced, as well as wind tunnels to allow for speedy traversal and new Limited Time Modes which rotate regularly mean that there's always some reason to return.\nAll in all, there's more than enough content to tempt back those yearning to complete some new Battle Pass challenges, but changes to Fortnite's map and meta make it a great place to compete alongside friends, especially since it continues to blaze a trail for cross-play and cross-progression. Being able to grind Battle Pass challenges on Switch or Mobile before returning to your console or PC to collect rewards still feels incredibly forward-thinking, even as other titles attempt to offer comparable services.\nSunshine, lollipops and rainbows\nDropping from the Battle Bus is always exciting.\n[Below is our original review of Fortnite at launch.]\nIn comparison to its more po-faced contemporaries such as Blackout or PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Fortnite's identity is all its own. Both the characters and the map are colourful, with a vibrancy that belies its tactical depth. Whether you're playing on a PC, a Nintendo Switch, or your mobile device, the game not only looks great but plays well too - perhaps entirely fitting given that Epic are the creators of the Unreal Engine (a suite of tools for game developers).\nThe lack of blood and gore makes it more child-friendly than other shooters, and the whole thing is wrapped in a Dreamworks-esque shell. Whether it's jumping out of the Party Bus to start a match, or picking up items like a launchpad to send you flying through the air, Fortnite feels reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon.\nThis personality filters down to the map itself - a hodgepodge of landscapes, from the urban skyscrapers of Tilted Towers, to the oasis-like Paradise Palms. Treasure chests are dotted around, each containing something useful, and Fortnite's reliance on a broader color palette than shades of greens and browns can make it easier to distinguish an opponent from a distance. \nFortnite’s map is as colourful as it is varied.\nWhile Fortnite still keeps its battles confined to a single map, variety comes in the form of seasonal updates and transformations which apply to all players. While one season brought about an ice age, another has added flyable aircraft. \nThese changes mean that the meta is in a state of constant flux, which may rile competitive players, but it keeps millions checking in on a regular basis to see what has changed. In fact, it wasn't long ago that the shooting stopped so that players could watch an in-game concert from current superstar DJ Marshmello.\nLast person standing\nFortnite’s floaty shooting takes some getting used to.\nOf course, with this being a Battle Royale, it's unlikely you'll find much time to look at the scenery. Thankfully, Fortnite's combat still feels surprisingly fresh almost two years in, and that's primarily down to two things.\nThe first is the game's unique building mechanic, a holdover from its Save The World mode. By harvesting materials like brick or wood with your trusty pickaxe, players are able to build rudimentary structures with an intuitive grid-based building system. If you're out in the open, you might aim to create a wall to take cover behind, while traversing sheer cliff faces is much easier when you can construct a ramp, or a series of steps when descending.\nFortnite cross-platform means you can take the fight anywhere.\nBuilding has long been a big part of Fortnite's difficulty curve, and it isn't uncommon to see the last ten combatants duke it out around a snaking series of ramps reaching into the heavens. The need to manage both building and shooting in increasingly confined spaces means Fortnite has a high skill ceiling, although it is entirely possible to brute force your way to a Victory Royale (something we're certainly guilty of). Epic's addition of a Creative Mode even allows for players to put together their own maps and custom game modes, adding even more to the longevity of Fortnite.\nA second key component of Fortnite's satisfying combat loop is in the shooting mechanics themselves. While it may seem strange to compare a third-person, cartoony battle royale to the developer's earlier work on Unreal Tournament, Fortnite's mobile, often strafe-heavy and \"loose\" shooting feels like it carries on that series' DNA.\nWeapons, for the most part, conform to standard archetypes of shotguns, sniper rifles and the like, but with Epic's commitment to shaking the game up at regular intervals we've seen weapons such as a Boogie Bomb, that causes enemies to dance, as well as remote-controlled missiles. Fortnite feels at its best when it revels in its own ludicrousness.\nPrice of a royale\nFortnite updates are constantly adding new features.\nReviewing a free-to-play title is a strange concept, because in Fortnite's case it can be easy to spend dozens of hours within its world without paying a single penny. Part of the game's appeal is it multi-platform ubiquity and the fact that it costs nothing.\nWhile there are many that would question the longevity of a title supported entirely by micro-transactions, Fortnite's paid items are purely cosmetic and often just as zany as one would expect from a title sporting such a colorful aesthetic. Character skins, dance moves, and new pickaxe designs are available, but Fortnite's greatest financial value can be found in its Battle Pass.\nCosting $9.99, the Fortnite Battle Pass allows for a steady stream of cosmetics that can be earned by simply playing the game and completing weekly challenges. These challenges are often a time for the community to come together and solve puzzles. Finishing one Battle Pass actually earns enough currency to buy the next one, too, and players that don't buy in will find their own stream of challenges.\nWalls have fallen\nAre you a master shooter or super stealther?\nIt's now easier than ever to pick up your fix of Fortnite on the go. With Sony finally acquiescing and allowing cross-play between PlayStation 4 and the previously walled-off versions of the game on other platforms, it's now entirely possible to play with your friends across multiple consoles.\nPerhaps just as important for many is the addition of cross-progression. If you purchase the Battle Pass on your Xbox One, for example, the same challenges will be available to complete on your Nintendo Switch - perfect for checking off your rewards while on the go. It isn't just the Battle Pass either - all of your purchases and currency can be found on all of your devices.\nSeasonal themes keep gameplay exciting.\nThere is a reason that Fornite is arguably the biggest game of the last decade. Its influence can be felt throughout pop culture as a whole because it walks the line of accessibility and that competitive spirit that many enjoy so much. \nBeneath all of the dances, the skins, and the Battle Pass, Fortnite Battle Royale is an excellently designed, ever-shifting platform of a game that respects a player's time whether they choose to spend money or not. There's enough of a learning curve to keep us coming back time and time again, while also being a fun place to play a quick game with a friend. It truly is a modern marvel.",

He relates to those kids, in a “there but for the grace of my basketball gifts go I” kind of way.\nA promise kept… @KingJames on the opening of the @IPROMISESchool in Akron! #ThisIsWhyWePlay pic.twitter.com/W0XM57oQKX\n— NBA (@NBA) July 30, 2018\nThis undertaking was a massive challenge for LeBron and his non-profit, but it wasn’t the only challenge he talked about on Monday. When talking to the assembled basketball media, he discussed the challenge of lifting the Lakers back up to the status that franchise expects (and has been nowhere near in recent years). Via Dave McMenamin of ESPN, from LeBron’s interview with Rachel Nichols of the same network .\n“I like the challenge of being able to help a team get to places that they haven’t been in quite a while,” James said. “And obviously the Lakers haven’t made the playoffs in a few years, but the Lakers organization and historical franchise matches up there with all the greats. You can look at the Cowboys and you can look at the Patriots, you can look at Manchester United, the Boston Celtics — these are like historical franchises. And for me to be a part of that, I think it’s a great move not only for me but for my family and for the history of basketball in general.”\nAs for the team assembled by Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka — a interesting young Lakers’ core with Brandon Ingram , Lonzo Ball , and Kyle Kuzma , now surrounded by some of the more interesting personalities of the league such as Lance Stephenson , Michael Beasley , Rajon Rondo , and JaVale McGee — LeBron has high expectations.\n“We just got guys that love to play basketball,” James told ESPN’s Rachel Nichols as part of a wide-ranging sit-down interview Monday at the opening of his I Promise School. “At the end of the day, guys that love to play ball, and that’s what they do every single day, I love that. I love that, and I think [Rob] Pelinka and Magic [Johnson] love that as well, and that’s why they made the signings. And bringing Lance and JaVale and Beas and Rondo, they’re guys that every day that they wake up they think about the game of basketball. And everything else is secondary.”\nLeBron is 33, will turn 34 next season, and while he hasn’t slowed down much yet (he just picks his spots more), does he feel the pressure to win another title in LA sooner rather than later?\n“I don’t even look at it like that because I don’t feel like this is going to be one of the last years of my prime,” James said. “That’s another statistic number, and I’ve always been a part of beating the odds in life. So being around my kids a lot, it gives me even more and more time in my youth.”\nLeBron also said he gave serious consideration to both Houston and Philadelphia, before choosing to move his family to Los Angeles.\nLeBron spoke about which teams he considered in free agency and why he chose the Lakers to media in Cleveland. He doesn't know what it will lead to, but he expects the Lakers to have \"championship habits.\" pic.twitter.com/7mP8abfMmI\n— TV's Harrison Faigen (@hmfaigen) July 30, 2018",

        "articleBody": "過去幾年來，跑了嘉義數次，為其做了些前期的城市建設相關規劃。每一次規劃，都是一次對它的文化資源盤點，總覺得這袖珍城市以它厚實的音樂、繪畫、林業歷史，適切的街道尺度，人口密度，肯定能成為跨世代的「微城市」文化重鎮。繼2018年火車站前廣場以輕盈的純白棚架結構物讓其公共空間更親民、更有質地後，2020年中周邊又有另一個文化地標的新亮點—— 「嘉義市立美術館」 。\n嘉美館建築由3棟建築組成，除了有興建於1936年的菸酒公賣局嘉義分局外，還包括1954 年酒類倉庫、1980年菸酒成品倉庫，建築形式具現代建築簡潔風格，兼具面磚大量使用時期的特色。 \n曾經打造東海大學人文大樓、彰化美術館的建築師黃明威，此次針對嘉美館的新舊並存增改建規劃，則有了更多面向「對話」的細膩度。除維持對周遭都市空間「打開」的慣有原則，黃建築師說，這回的空間策略上更希望達到「Hub」的概念。因此，相較東海的人文大樓對已登記為文化資產的路思義教堂方向打開，彰化美術館對縣議會前大馬路的開放，但對緊鄰的武德殿著墨較少，較為可惜。六年後興建完成的嘉美館，在後巷對市民的日常生活打開，進而達到匯聚的效果。雖在大馬路中山路上有其入口，更特別的是對能匯聚人流，嘉義典型的小尺度巷弄空間的廣寧街開啟，並在三棟新舊建築間圍塑成一內凹廣場，成為嘉義常民生活的一部分。看得出來，建築師在一次次的文化場館設計的過程中，為達到與「在地日常」對話，一再進化諸多可能的嘗試。\n從內凹的廣場入內，輕盈的玻璃量體構成的美術館本館，是三棟主建築唯一新建的建築體，其鑲嵌了主入口，內部挑高的空間，襯著木質紋理的壁面面材。樓層間的動線流動，出挑的室內陽台，可以對外眺望的廊道，更與外面的廣場構成一「看與被看」的關係。彷若傳統廟埕露天電影院的意象，未來入內參觀的「人」即是廣場前投映的「劇」。因此，面對既有「市定古蹟」的「重」，與過去的文化展館的「高」不可攀，建築師將「人」成為空間的主角，更是室內外空間對話很重要的一個的催化劑。\n撐起美術館本館主要空間的結構物是以較輕量的新型木構材CLT(Cross Laminated Timber工法完成，以維持空間通透性。這種多層次結構基材工法可將建物的結構負擔大大減輕，伴隨內部的鐵片可以達到必需的結構表現，然而其木構造的樣貌更具能隨時間均勻變色，在時間的推移下，與周邊的舊建築達到色調調和的效果。\n亮點5：新舊調味的「咖哩理論」\n面對中山路的古蹟棟，相較美術館本館其外牆更顯厚重。黃建築師回憶起一次在歐洲旅行的啟發，將美術館本館接續古蹟棟的背面牆面以複層外牆的方式讓規律的外牆開窗因一玻璃皮層的附加，有了大大小小豐富開窗的趣味立面表現。新的表情鑲嵌在印有舊有立面瓷磚分割的玻璃上，更加呼應了以咖哩為新舊調味的概念。\n這棟以「Hub」為概念的全新文化場所，首展推出《辶反風景》。嘉義的別名即為「畫都」，展出從30年代陳澄波大師的作品到當下的新媒體藝術創作，邀您一起穿越時空，從圖像世界看見嘉義的多元樣貌，相信啟幕後能擦亮專屬嘉義的文化厚度！",

The fast-food chain now offers a hand-spun vanilla milkshake that’s dotted with a rainbow of M&M’s candies . The different-colored candies make the drink look like it’s been sprinkled with colorful confetti.\nIt’s still winter, but Burger King’s website urges diners to “cool down” with the new shake, which blends vanilla soft serve, M&M’s chocolate candies, and vanilla syrup, crowning the shake with a dollop of whipped topping.\nBetter not wait too long, though. A Burger King representative told The Daily Meal in an email that the shake is available only while supplies last. It’s priced at $3.99.\nWhile you’re at Burger King, you may want to further satisfy your sweet tooth with a treat that’s returned from the 1990s. A fan favorite, the gooey miniature cinnamon rolls called Cini Minis are back on the restaurant’s menu, also for a limited time.\nAnd if you’re still thinking about ordering that shake, sure, M&M’s are tasty and colorful, but they’re a relatively tame ingredient compared to many milkshake add-ins.

        "articleBody": "We're just going to come out and say it: Women can run, lift, plank, and climb as well as (if not better than) any sweaty dude sporting a cut-off T-shirt at the gym. Sometimes, guys just need a little reminder that being a woman isn’t synonymous for being a weakling. Check out how seven women reduced big, bad men to little boys—and just try not to spit your protein shake all over the floor.\n“I’m 5 feet tall and weigh maybe 105 or 115 pounds. I wouldn't know exactly since I never get on a scale. But aesthetically, I don't look like a bodybuilder and my petite size is misleading. So one day, when the squat rack was free, I proceeded to start my warmup. As I was getting ready to start, this guy, maybe 6’7” tall, comes and asks how many I have left. I politely let him know I was just starting but that he could feel free to jump in. I let him go first. As he racked the plates, I warmed up doing burpees. When he finished, he started to take off a plate. I politely said, ‘No don't remove that.’ He looked at me, puzzled, and asked, ‘Are you doing the same weight?’ I smiled and said, ‘No, I want to add another plate.’ I started to do my set. Before I even finished, he had left.” — Malvina P.\n“I was doing a fitness challenge at my gym about five years ago and was paired against another guy. Each of us were supposed to hold a plank, which I love to challenge myself in, for as long as we could. Going into it, the guy was told that my previous plank personal record was seven minutes and 30 seconds. So guess what? He holds his plank for 7 minutes and 35 seconds. Then, I held mine for eight minutes and 20 seconds.” —Kimberly M.\n\"He looked at me, puzzled, and asked, ‘Are you doing the same weight?’ I smiled and said, ‘No, I want to add another plate.’\"\n“Shortly after we started dating, I asked my boyfriend to lift with me at my gym. According to him, he lifted every day, so I didn’t think joining me would be all that challenging. Little did he know, though, that he was walking into my territory, where chicks lift heavy and push just as hard as any guy. He ended up making it through about 20 minutes of my workout before he disappeared to the restroom for the next 20 minutes. He returned pale but ready to give it another go. Later that morning, he had to drive about an hour to work and actually had to walk backward up the stairs so his legs wouldn’t crumble under him. Today, we're married, and he survives the gym daily with me—but he still takes breaks in the bathroom while I secretly smile and continue my sets.” —Jess K.\n“While I was training for my first half-marathon , the weather forced me inside for more than a few long runs. About halfway through one, a guy hopped on the treadmill next to me. As I saw him peeking at my screen, he quickly adjusted his speed to exactly match mine. 'So annoying,' I thought. But I wasn’t going to screw up my pacing by trying to beat him at his own racing game. It turns out, I didn’t need to. About a mile into his run, he slowed it down to a walk, huffing and puffing like he had been doing an all-out sprint. I ran four more miles after that.\"  —Christine R.\n\"Little did he know, though, that he was walking into my territory, where chicks lift heavy and push just as hard as any guy.\"\n“I don't max lift often, but one day when I was max lifting on the leg press, I started with one plate on each side. The guy on the leg press next to me had three on each. I caught him glancing at my weight and giggling. His giggling subsided when he stopped at six plates on each side and I kept on going. I continued to add a plate to each side until I had 20 plates total. No, I can't do this every day and only did three reps with that weight—but I will admit that it felt good to shut that one dude up. Who knows, maybe he helped me PR that day.” — Angela H.\n“My husband and I used to do workout routines from health and fitness magazines together. I would pull out my sets of weights and tell him to get heavier ones. But he usually ended up grabbing lighter ones like mine, resting more, and complaining. He wasn't a fan of my tips on his technique and form, either. We've done more separate workouts lately.

        "articleBody": "\"America was built by John Lewises,\" Obama said. \"He, as much as anyone in our history, brought this country a little bit closer to our highest ideals. And someday, when we do finish that long journey towards freedom, when we do form a more perfect union ... John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.\"\nIt was a dramatic return to the political fray for a former president who has steadfastly worked to avoid becoming a foil for Trump, even as he frets privately and to Democratic donors about Trump's actions and words.\nBut it was also a deeply personal recognition of a life Obama admitted was necessary for his own political ascent.\n\"Imagine the courage of two people Malia's age -- younger than my oldest daughter -- on their own, to challenge an entire infrastructure of oppression,\" he said, evoking his 22-year-old eldest child. \"John was only 20 years old but he pushed all 20 of those years onto the center of the table.\"\nAt a moment when the country is reckoning anew over questions of systemic racism following the police killings of George Floyd , Breonna Taylor and countless other Black and Brown Americans, Thursday's funeral was a measuring moment: Both a time to reflect on the grainy black-and-white newsreels of another generation's struggle and an opportunity to assess where that struggle continues to come up short.\nIt was the type of remembrance that marks the passage of a nation's history, provides a record of its highest and lowest moments and lays down a marker for the type of person -- the type of hero -- deserving of the country's attention and respect.\nLewis' own words kicked off the day of remembrance, with a post-humous op-ed in The New York Times , that echoed the principles with which he lived his life.\n\"When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something. Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part to help build what we called the Beloved Community, a nation and world society at peace with itself,\" he wrote, recalling his own lessons from King.\n\"It is so fitting on the day of his service, he leaves us our marching orders: Keep moving,\" former President Bill Clinton said during the funeral.\n\"He got into a lot of good trouble along the way but let's not forget he also developed an absolutely uncanny ability to heal troubled waters,\" Clinton added. \"He thought that the open hand was better than the clenched fist.\"\nWhile not at all unexpected, the absence Thursday of the sitting president was conspicuous. Remembering heroes was once something Washington could agree on, an idea that has increasingly seemed to be a relic from another time.\nLewis' funeral wasn't the first high-profile memorial that Trump has skipped, and as both a lifetime member of the nation's most exclusive club and a renowned grudge-holder, it likely will not be the last.\nYet however obvious it was, Trump's decision to forgo paying his respects -- which he declared decisively even before his aides could weigh the pros and cons -- was still a stark reminder of the rabidly polarized era of politics over which he presides.\nHe has continued to stoke a racial divide that Lewis spent his life working to bridge. As the country buckled earlier this summer under racial tensions and outcry over police brutality, Trump harkened back to 1960s rhetoric that wouldn't have been unfamiliar to Lewis, who was beaten and bloodied by police during the civil rights movement.\nAs Trump evoked \"vicious dogs\" that would restore order and used a phrase coined by a racist police chief in 1968 to warn that \"when the looting starts the shooting starts,\" Lewis encouraged protesters to continue the work that he started decades ago.\nThe comparisons to a darker era that many hoped had faded were made explicit in Obama's eulogy.\n\"George Wallace may be gone, but we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators,\" he said, referring to the segregationist Alabama governor who ran for president on a hard-right platform in 1968.\nEven as recently as this week, Trump has used a rollback of a federal anti-segregation rule to appeal to White suburbanites , a tactic that seems to have a direct line to the racist policies Lewis was seeking to overturn half a century ago.\nIt's hard to imagine how those messages or that messenger would have fit in at Lewis' funeral. Yet political leaders have long put aside even their biggest differences to commemorate those few lives that can be said to have altered history.\n\"John and I had our disagreements, of course,\" former President George W. Bush said during the funeral on Thursday. \"But, in the America John Lewis fought for and in the America I believe in, differences of opinion are inevitable elements and evidence of democracy in action.\"\nObama-Lewis vision of America\nSpeaking in 2015 at the 50th anniversary memorial of the \"Bloody Sunday\" march in Selma, Alabama -- an event that brought together Republicans and Democrats alike -- Obama seemed to predict an era of White nostalgia that would come to pass as a patriotic litmus test under Trump.\nCiting marchers like Lewis who were beaten by state troopers as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on their way to Montgomery to demand voting rights, Obama said that was true patriotism -- a stark contrast to Trump, who has decried protesters as un-American and intent on erasing history.\n\"That's what it means to love America. That's what it means to believe in America,\" Obama said of the marchers, adding later: \"That's what America is, not stock photos or airbrushed history or feeble attempts to define some of us as more American as others.\"\nHe repeated some of those themes Thursday, hailing Lewis' example as one to emulate.\n\"That's where real courage comes from -- not from turning on each other but by turning towards one another,\" Obama said. \"Not by sowing hatred and division but by spreading love and truth. Not by avoiding our responsibilities to create a better America and a better world but by embracing those responsibilities with joy and perseverance. And discovering that, in our beloved community, we do not walk alone.\"\nThat vision of America is not necessarily shared by Obama's successor, who has used monuments and statues, including those to Confederate generals, as a rallying cry in his reelection bid.\nBoth men have governed during times of intense racial divide: Obama reckoned with racially charged protests in Missouri and Maryland during his second term, and Trump now confronts ongoing unrest and outcry over the more recent police killings.\nIt was always unlikely that Obama would forgo the opportunity on Thursday to raise, again, the issues of racial disparity that continue to grip the nation.\nIn his speech, Obama listed a series of items that he said would make voting more fair and ensure every American is enfranchised: restoring the Voting Rights Act, allowing former inmates to vote, adding polling locations, making Election Day a federal holiday and allowing Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico to have full representation in Congress.\nHe also called for an end to the filibuster, the Senate rule that has allowed the minority party to stall legislation and that Obama called a remnant of Jim Crow.\nObama has used funerals in the past to deliver searing speeches on race -- most notably during a eulogy for the murdered pastor of a Charleston church that ended with a sung verse of \"Amazing Grace.\"\nAnd while he has openly attributed the possibility of his election to forebears like Lewis -- \"I was only there because of the sacrifices he made,\" Obama said he told Lewis at his inauguration -- he has also been frank that neither the fact he was elected nor the efforts he made while in office have been enough to combat still-existent racial divides.\n\"Thanks to him, we now all have our marching orders -- to keep believing in the possibility of remaking this country we love until it lives up to its full promise,\" Obama said in his statement following Lewis' death earlier this month.\nNearly every other American political leader in Washington -- including Vice President Mike Pence, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden -- paid in-person tribute to Lewis this week in some fashion.\nA cursory acknowledgment\nTrump did issue a cursory statement on Twitter following the civil rights leader's death and ordered flags lowered: \"Saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family,\" he tweeted.\nIt did not go unnoticed that his Twitter remembrance of the late television host Regis Philbin, who also died recently, was nearly three times as long.\nIn an era of intense political divides, Trump's decision to avoid Lewis' funeral is not surprising. Lewis refused to attend Trump's inauguration in 2017 and declared him an illegitimate president. Trump subsequently said Lewis should focus on improving his district, calling it \"crime infested.\"\nWhen Trump announced unequivocally that he would not travel to the Capitol to pay his respects, some aides were caught off-guard because the issue hadn't been decisively settled on internally, one administration official said.\nTrump's distaste for the rituals of remembrance and tradition for people he dislikes have by now been well established. While he has shown an affinity for some trappings of his job, the President has little patience for its rituals when they do not revolve around him. Aides have said they have little interest in bringing Trump to places he is clearly unwelcome and could become a distraction.\nHe has shown similar disregard -- and at times open hostility -- for those idolized by most of the Washington establishment, at least in death. He was pointedly not invited to the funeral held in the Washington National Cathedral for Sen. John McCain, who was eulogized instead by two former presidents, George W. Bush and Obama.\nInstead of attending that funeral, Trump played a round of golf and, according to aides, sulked at the attention and adulation being mounted upon one of his avowed nemeses. Later, he complained that McCain's family never thanked him for approving certain aspects of the service.\nThe one prominent funeral that Trump did attend, for former President George H.W. Bush, remains the only time he's come face-to-face with his living predecessors since his inauguration. The encounter, at least by the looks of video footage, was chilly.\nThis month, Trump removed portraits of the younger Bush and Clinton that were hanging prominently in the White House and moved them to a room used to store tablecloths and unused furniture.",

        "articleBody": "平台還能夠整合破碎的資訊，增進市場的媒合效率。讓使用者能透過平台分享資訊、交流意見，促進更多互動。互動能消除「資訊不對稱」的問題，例如，電子商城透過消費者評價機制，讓消費者能夠清楚瞭解商品，也能在平台上獲得更好的消費體驗。\n對的品牌定位能夠呈現與競爭者的差異，也能同時建立品牌在消費者心目中的不可替代性。而導入平台模式的品牌同樣需要有品牌定位的過程，因為品牌定位影響了後續平台經營策略，從機制設計、形象塑造到行銷策略都層層相扣。\n以Youtube為例，Youtube 是知名的影音串流平台，Youtube將品牌定位為「提供使用者自由發聲的機會。」 (Give everyone a voice and show them the world.) Youtube 勝過於其他競爭品牌的關鍵就是平台的「高度開放性」，成立初期 Youtube幾乎沒有篩選制度，任何使用者都可以自由的上傳影片、影片支援絕大部分的格式，影片甚至可以內嵌於其他網站平台。讓使用者分享影片、自由表達意見的門檻降到最低。「高度開放性」促進了Youtube前期的擴展速度，同時也奠定Youtube在消費者心目中「自由開發」的價值。\n二、從品牌價值延伸到平台機制設計\n電商龍頭Amazon就是從品牌價值延伸到平台機制設計的最佳案例， Amazon 網路商城的品牌價值有 「杜絕假品牌」、「增進賣家品質」、「提供最佳消費體驗」。圍繞著這些核心價值，Amazon 設計出一系列的平台機制。\n舉「Buy Box」這個平台機制為例，Buy Box又稱為黃金購物車，是Amazon為了杜絕假品牌與增進賣家品質而設計的。搶到Buy Box的賣家會成為消費者優先看到的賣家，比起沒有搶到Buy Box的賣家銷售量平均高出四倍。\n那怎麼樣的賣家可以搶到Buy Box？符合「專業賣家」、賣家評價高、販售全新的商品，使用 Amazon 自有的倉儲與物流服務都會增加機率，Buy Box機制不但增進賣家品質，也讓 Amazon 獲得額外的收入。\nAmazon 垂直整合了倉儲與物流服務後，成本降低後 Amazon 依舊選擇向賣家收費，同時為買家提供更優良的倉儲與物流服務，這也是在彰顯Amazon以消費者為優先的核心價值。\n三、平台品牌如何推廣與行銷\n也有的平台品牌選擇透過多角化的策略逐漸佔據我們的生活，加深品牌影響力。例如Uber從交通服務延伸到外送服務、Yahoo拍賣從網路商城到直播拍賣，甚至開始培育拍賣平台的專屬直播主。\n至於平台品牌的行銷活動，行銷不只是要創造話題性，更需要持續累積品牌聲量，例如 Airbnb奇屋一夜的行銷活動，巴黎羅浮宮、披頭四的錄音室、公牛隊的主場、被鯊魚圍繞的海底玻璃房間，這些我們意想不到的場所，都成為了Airbnb 的住宿空間，讓消費者有機會在這些場所住上一晚。奇屋一夜系列活動成功抓住大眾的目光，也拓展了Airbnb異業合作的範圍，同時提高Airbnb在消費者心目中的品牌價值。\n不論你的品牌是一開始就以平台模式操作，或著想要導入平台模式，進行數位化經營的傳統企業，都是很好的策略方向。但要切記平台模式要圍繞著品牌定位，品牌定位是企業在消費者心中建立的品牌形象、是與其他競爭品牌的差異，更是決定品牌走向的關鍵。",

After hours of labor, Mota’s obstetrician, Dr. Sandra Lopez, made the decision to call for emergency C-section surgery after the fetal heart beat could no longer be detected, according to the San Diego Tribune . When the anesthesiologist, Dr. David Seif, could not be located, Lopez moved forward with the C-section surgery anyway, Mota claims.\n“Page him, keep paging him,” she told the Tribune she could hear the doctor saying in the operating room.\n“All of the sudden I felt cutting on my stomach … a burning sensation,” she said, before passing out from the pain.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Mota was “crying and screaming at the top of her lungs, that she could feel everything that was happening, and was also pleading for help.” The suit says that the anesthesiologist appeared in the operating room about halfway through the surgery.\n“I understand why they did it,” she said to the Tribune . “But this is a hospital… There should have been measures in place.” The baby girl, named Cali, was delivered healthy and is now about seven months old.\n“There was nothing they could have told me to prepare me for the screams that I heard and the feeling that I got when they started the surgery,” Paul Iheanachor, 35, the baby’s father, told the Tribune . “I heard the screams, the horrific screams. That’s when I realized they were cutting her without anesthesia.”\nThe hospital said it does not usually comment on pending litigation, but that Mota’s “public discussion of the care she received during her emergency C-section compels us to address this outrageous allegation. The patient was administered anesthesia prior to the surgery. We are pleased that the baby is ‘healthy’ and ‘happy.’”\nThe lawsuit, which names the hospital, surgeon and the anesthesiologist alleges “medical malpractice, loss of consortium, negligent infliction of emotional distress and assault and battery,” according to the Tribune . Mota’s lawyer, Norman Finkelstein, said in 35 years as a lawyer he’s “never seen anything like it.”\nAlthough the lawsuit does not include financial details, the claim the couple filed against Tri-City Medical Center prior to the lawsuit was for $5.75 million, the Tribune reports.",

Entre le mercredi 19 avril et le mercredi 9 juin, il ne sera possible (sauf pour les sportifs de haut niveau et le public prioritaire) de pratiquer une activité physique qu’à l’extérieur, comme c’est le cas actuellement. Les premiers changements apparaîtront le 9 juin avec d’une part la possibilité de reprendre le sport de contact en extérieur (notamment le football pour les amateurs, qui jusqu’à présent devaient se contenter de jeux individuels) et d’autre part de refaire du sport en salle, mais cette fois sans contact.\nConcernant les activités libres de plein air, autorisées pendant le confinement, les contraintes vont peu à peu être allégées. La limite actuelle de 6 personnes passera à 10 le mercredi 19 mai puis à 25 le 9 juin. Ce n’est qu’à compter de cette date que les contacts seront possibles et que la partie de football entre copains dans un parc ou de basket dans les playground sera autorisée.\nLa reprise sonne également pour les compétitions sportives de plein air sur l’espace public (épreuves cyclistes ou de running…) mais de façon extrêmement progressive. Ainsi, entre le 19 mai et le 9 juin, les courses ne pourront accueillir que 50 participants maximum. La jauge passera ensuite à 500 puis à 2 500.

        "articleBody": "Right now the motoring world is practically wetting itself over the return of Toyota’s legendary sports car. We’re talking about the Supra of course, but there’s a promising designer at Bēhance.net that hasn’t forgotten about Toyota’s other legendary performance machine, one for which we should all be grateful. If it wasn’t for this car’s short-but-sweet tenure back in the late 1960s, the Supra may have never been born. In fact, it’s not a stretch to say all awesome Japanese sports cars – from the 240Z and Skyline to the NSX – owe their existence to this iconic Toyota . The 2000GT showed the world that Japan could build more than small hatchbacks, and the world listened. That's why you'll struggle to find an original 2000GT selling for less than $1 million these days.\nWe need more 2000GT in our life:\nNow, it’s been reimagined as a modern machine in this cool render, and for the most part, we like what we see. There’s certainly plenty of influence from the new Supra, which isn’t a bad thing. Even though the car hasn’t been officially revealed just yet, the double-bubble roof and tiny rear window slanted upwards are straight from the preproduction models we’ve seen. The sculpted sides are taken from the new Supra as well, but the front is where the big changes exist.\nNestled into the gaping grille are the 2000GT’s trademark driving lamps, though if we’re honest, we could do with a bit more slope to the hood and a bit less gaping grille. Okay, a lot less grille. And while we’re at it, a bit more side glass on the rear pillars would really give this Supra-esque 2000GT concept a bit more individuality. That said, we love how this render also shows the designer’s sketches that evolved to bring this creation to life in the 3D world.\nMore on the way:\nThis rendering got us talking around the Motor1.com office . Toyota is in the process of recapturing some of the enthusiast excitement that the brand lost through the 2000s. The Supra will certainly help that cause, but with BMW involved so heavily in the development, we can’t help but think there will be purists who denounce the new Supra as a badge-engineered Bimmer. We can’t think of a better way to silence the naysayers than to revive the 2000GT as a niche halo car slotted above the Supra.\nAre you listening Toyota? This is a great idea.",

And despite all of their wedding guests already being in Italy for their destination nuptials, Upton made her way to Los Angeles to support her then fiance’s life-changing moment.\nBut the 26-year-old model isn’t the only supportive cheerleader in the relationship.\n\"I have been to some of her shows, but our schedules are so tough,\" Verlander told Fox News in March, adding that he loves to cheer on his wife when he is free. \"On my off-season, I try to get out and support her when I can.\"\nNow, the famous couple is working to balance their hectic schedules with a baby. The new parents recently announced the birth of their daughter, Genevieve Upton Verlander.\n“Welcome to the world Genevieve Upton Verlander. You stole my (heart) the first second I met you!!!” the proud father wrote, adding Wednesday’s date to the message – suggesting that the child was born three days before the announcement.\nFox News' Dom Calicchio contributed to this report. ",

        "articleBody": "Korean Blockchain/Cryptocurrency startup, Gameper Co., Ltd., has launched ‘Bitro’ . It is a global app for trading cryptocurrencies with other digital assets in the P2P market aimed at helping the world take advantage of the special ‘Kimchi Premium.’ Bitro’ supports many payment methods such as mobile gift cards, e-cards, and mobile points.\n‘ Freedom ’  and  ‘ Secure ’  are the two main values  ‘ Bitro’ brings to the P2P market\n‘Bitro’ traders can buy/sell bitcoins by setting a price above or below the currency price. You can either set a price or use a percentage to determine the price you wish to trade. A simple percentage slider is provided for easier interaction. If a percentage is set, the seller’s price will change according to the current market price and the percentage the trader has set. ‘Bitro’ will then calculate all the necessary information and provide the trader with a final price to be traded on. All you have to do is focus on the final price.\nThe current payment methods ‘Bitro’ provides are bank transfers, mobile gift cards, e-cards, and mobile points. But since trades are conducted via private chats, traders can use any kind of payment method they wish by mentioning different payment methods through hashtags or during a chat. Hashtags can also be used to promote your trade or add additional conditions to your trade.\nP2P markets can be tricky since you are trading with someone you don’t know online. ‘Bitro’ wants to change that by providing an automated escrow service with a tight dispute management team. Once a trade begins, the seller’s bitcoins are automatically escrowed. Then the trade proceeds via an automated chat sequence. You will be able to chat freely, but in order to progress the trade, you would need to go through the chat sequences. Think of them as instructions for a smooth and safe trading experience. Once the trade is complete, the seller’s bitcoins are automatically released and sent to the buyer.\nAll trades can be disputed with the ‘Dispute’ button if a trade does not complete, or something suspicious happens during a trade. The ‘Dispute’ button files the current trade into a dispute, and a ‘Bitro’ representative is contacted. Then the dispute team will contact both parties and review the dispute. Most disputes take less than 30 minutes to be resolved, helping to provide a seamless P2P trade experience.\n‘Bitro’ helps traders to make a profit by using the ‘Kimchi Premium.’ The ‘Kimchi Premium’ happens when Korean cryptocurrency exchanges have a higher price than most global exchanges. By using ‘Bitro,’ a trader can sell their cryptocurrencies at a higher price in Korea without the hassle of creating an account in a Korean exchange.\nCurrently ‘Bitro’ only supports bitcoins as a tradable cryptocurrency but will be supporting a lot more digital assets such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, etc., in the near future. Gameper CEO ‘ChesterLee’ sees ‘the crypto/Blockchain market becoming more regulated, which is positive for the market and will help expand the global market in general. ‘Bitro’ is available on both iOS and Android devices.\nWhat’s your thoughts?",

SSG 클라우드 서비스를 제공받는 계열사는 신세계백화점 이마트 스타벅스 면세점 스타필드 등 23곳이다. 가상데스크톱인프라(VDI), 그룹웨어, SAP 전사적자원관리(ERP) 등 다양한 기존 애플리케이션이 뉴타닉스 플랫폼상에서 운영되고 있다.\n수산·해양·물류·식품가공 및 유통 서비스를 제공하는 19개 계열사를 운영하는 동원그룹은 뉴타닉스 HCI를 전사 차원의 핵심 IT 인프라로 도입해 프라이빗 클라우드 환경을 구축했다. 더욱이 SAP ERP와 연계 시스템을 유닉스에서 리눅스(U2L)로 전환했다.\n동원그룹은 오랫동안 유닉스에서 애플리케이션과 워크로드를 실행해왔다. 유닉스는 확장성과 비용 측면에서 유지관리에 어려움이 있었고, 인프라 증설과 교체도 어려워 노후화됐다. 증가하는 IT 리소스와 워크로드에 적절히 대응하기 어려운 수준에 도달했다. 이에 따라 차세대 IT 인프라 구축 사업을 추진, 기존 29대의 SAP 시스템과 웹 기간 시스템을 리눅스로 전환하고 SDDC 인프라 솔루션을 구축했다. 리눅스에서 실행되는 애플리케이션 운영·관리를 위한 핵심 인프라로 뉴타닉스 플랫폼을 도입했다.\n그 결과 동원그룹은 전체 인프라 용량의 60% 이상을 차지하는 SAP를 비롯해 다양한 애플리케이션과 워크로드를 손쉽게 배포, 확장, 유지관리할 수 있게 됐고, 성능도 크게 향상되는 효과를 거뒀다.\n배 상무는 “클라우드 전환으로 동원그룹은 디지털 트랜스포메이션 대응, 비용절감, 직원 생산성 증대까지 최고정보책임자(CIO)의 세 가지 고민을 해결할 수 있었다”라면서 “동원그룹 인프라는 제조·생산시설 운영에 있어 서비스 연속성을 지속할 수 있는 안정적이고 확장이 쉬운 인프라가 필요했다. ERP 역시 물류 ERP로 트랜젝션과 실시간 업무가 많아 서비스 연속성이 중요했다. 추가 신규 장비 도입과 유지보수·운영 비용 측면에서 90% 가까운 비용 절감 효과를 거둘 수 있었고, 23가지 ERP 애플리케이션 성능은 두 배 가까이 향상돼, 하드웨어 인프라 투자비와 운영 비용이 크게 절감되는 결과를 얻었다”고 설명했다.",

Tuy nhiên, kì nghỉ xả hơi của Quỷ đỏ đã không được diễn ra trọn vẹn.\nTheo tờ Mirror, đoàn quân của HLV Ole Solskjaer định lưu trú tại khách sạn Westin La Quinta nhưng họ đã phải chuyển địa điểm sau khi nhận được tin tức về những vị khách đã từng đến đây. Trước đó vài ngày, cũng có một đội bóng đã lựa chọn khách sạn này, đó chính là câu lạc bộ Đại Liên Á Nhĩ Tân, Trung Quốc.\nNguyên nhân cho sự thay đổi ở phút chót này không gì khác ngoài những lo ngại về dịch corona. Được biết virus Covid-19 hoàn toàn có thể tồn tại ngoài môi trường từ 5-7 ngày. Do vậy, khả năng nhiễm bệnh của các thành viên MU là hoàn toàn có thể nếu như họ không đổi chỗ ở.\nGiống như MU, đội bóng Trung Quốc cũng cảnh giác cao độ với dịch bệnh này. Cho nên, họ đã lựa chọn tạm lánh ở nước ngoài trong thời điểm dịch bệnh bùng phát. Đại Liên là một đội bóng nổi tiếng bậc nhất Trung Quốc khi sở hữu nhiều hảo thủ như Marek Hamsik, Rondon và HLV huyền thoại của Liverpool, Rafa Benitez.\nBan lãnh đạo đội bóng nước Anh sau đó đã phải chuyển sang lưu trú tại một khách sạn xa hơn có tên là Kempinski.",

        "articleBody": "美国民主党总统候选人拜登（Joe Biden）在2020年美国大选中获胜，成为下一任美国总统。他将采取怎样的对华政策引发外界关注。\n在拜登四十多年的从政生涯中，他曾多次访华，并与中国国家主席习近平“建立了良好的关系”。但他在参选美国总统的过程中称他将比美国现任总统特朗普（Donald Trump）对中国更加强硬。\n中国人民大学国际关系学院教授时殷弘认为，拜登很可能会采取一种不同于特朗普政府自2020年4月以来的对华根本目标，即迫使中国退回较宽松的体制。拜登更担忧与中国重大军事冲突的可能性，更注意美中之间较高层外交沟通和对话，以防止两国间的外交“脱钩”。此外，拜登在中美贸易战上和中国持有相同观点，认为它过大地损害美国商界和美国消费者。\n路透社11月6日报道，瑞士百达资产管理公司首席策略师鲍里尼（Luca Paolini）认为，拜登不会在贸易政策上做出重大改变，但会减少与中国的抗衡态度。\n随着拜登成为新一任美国总统，他与中国的40年往来将会迎来一个顶峰。鉴于两个全球超级大国一个正在崛起，另一个则试图保持其影响力，中美间更大的冲突或许不可避免。",
