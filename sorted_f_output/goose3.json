        "articleBody": "The Steelers spent Monday trying to distance themselves from Thursday night's fight that led to multi-game suspensions for Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett and Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey. Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also received a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\n\nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson, however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight on Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his role in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\n\nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. … You get what's coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\n\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine Rudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds.\n\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more focused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game winning streak come to an end.\n\n\"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of things, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much. That's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to learn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\n\nThe Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as the NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25 kickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to facing the Browns again.\n\n\"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I don't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot [again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at home, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got to put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game, so our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"",

        "articleBody": "Why F1's inconvenient penalties have to stay OPINION: Quibbles over the length of time taken by Formula 1's stewards over decisions are entirely valid. But however inconvenient it is, there can be no questioning the importance of having clearly defined rules that everyone understands and can stick to. Recent events have shown that ambiguity could have big consequences\n\nThe mistakes Red Bull cannot afford to repeat in F1 2021's title fight climax OPINION: Red Bull has had Formula 1’s fastest package for most of 2021, but in several of the title run-in events it has wasted the RB16B’s potential. It cannot afford to do so again with Lewis Hamilton motoring back towards Max Verstappen in the drivers’ standings with two rounds remaining\n\nQatar was a virtual unknown for most as Formula 1 made its inaugural visit to the Gulf state, and tyre management quickly emerged as an even more critical factor than normal. Perhaps then it should come as no surprise that two of the championship's elder statesmen produced standout drives\n\nHow Hamilton dominated in Qatar despite missing a key Mercedes advantage There was simply no stopping Lewis Hamilton on Formula 1's first visit to Qatar. The Mercedes driver eased to pole position and led every lap to secure an utterly dominant victory - even without a key Mercedes weapon in his arsenal to increase the heat on Red Bull heading into the final two races of the gripping 2021 title race\n\nQatar is preparing to host the football World Cup next year, but will be thrown into the sporting spotlight this weekend as Formula 1 prepares to race in the country. Ahead of a 10-year deal to hold a grand prix from 2023 onwards, it's a much-needed opportunity to highlight reforms in the country\n\nThe times that reinforce Mercedes' strong start to F1's first Qatar GP Mercedes arrived in Qatar off the back of Lewis Hamilton’s stunning win in Brazil and it ended the first day of running on top at the Losail track. While it’s not just on one-lap pace where the Black Arrows squad looks good again versus Red Bull, there’s signs of encouragement in the data for Max Verstappen’s squad too...\n\nFormula 1’s expansion into new territories hasn’t been greeted with uniform positivity but, says BEN EDWARDS, the Middle East and Africa represent important new territory for motorsport - and the benefits are already starting to emerge\n\nThe principles at stake in the Verstappen/Hamilton Turn 4 clash OPINION: The FIA's decision not to investigate Max Verstappen for his move to repel Lewis Hamilton's challenge for the lead of the Brazilian Grand Prix, which resulted in both going off the track, has become the latest polarised incident in the dramatic 2021 Formula 1 title battle. Regardless of which side of the fence you sit on, the lack of consistency from those upholding the rules should be seen as a point of concern.",

        "articleBody": "JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Legendary South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela has died at the age of 78 after a decade-long fight with cancer, according to a statement from his family on Tuesday.\n\nOften called the “Father of South African jazz,” Masekela died in Johannesburg after what his family said was a “protracted and courageous battle with prostate cancer.”\n\nTrumpeter, singer and composer Masekela, affectionately known locally as “Bra Hugh,” started playing the horn at 14 and quickly became an integral part of the 1950s jazz scene in Johannesburg as a member of the Jazz Epistles.\n\nIn the 1960s he went into exile in the United Kingdom and the United States, where he collaborated with American jazz legend Harry Belafonte and used his music to spread awareness about the oppressive system of white-minority rule in South Africa. He also scored an international number one hit in 1968 with “Grazing In The Grass.”\n\nHe collaborated with many musicians including Paul Simon and Herb Alpert. He was married to South African singer and activist Miriam Makeba for two years.\n\nMany of his compositions were about the struggle for majority rule and full democratic rights in South Africa. Masekela’s catchy composition “Bring Him Back Home” calling for Nelson Mandela to be released from prison became an international anthem for the anti-apartheid movement.\n\n“Hugh’s global and activist contribution to and participation in the areas of music, theatre, and the arts in general is contained in the minds and memory of millions across six continents,” the family statement read.\n\nIn October last year, Masekela issued a statement that he had been fighting prostate cancer since 2008 and would have to cancel his professional commitments to focus on his health. He said he started treatment after doctors found a “small ‘speck'” on his bladder, and had surgery in March 2016 after the cancer spread.\n\nMasekela also said he felt an “imbalance” and had an eye problem after a fall in April in Morocco in which he sprained his shoulder.\n\nHe said another tumor was then discovered and he had surgery.\n\n“I’m in a good space, as I battle this stealthy disease, and I urge all men to have regular tests to check your own condition,” his statement said, asking the media for privacy.\n\nCondolences from fans poured out Tuesday on social media paying tribute to the influential musician’s career.\n\n“A baobob tree has fallen,” Nathi Mthethwa, South Africa’s minister for arts and culture, wrote on Twitter. “The nation has lost a one of a kind musician . We can safely say Bra Hugh was one of the great architects of Afro-Jazz and he uplifted the soul of our nation through his timeless music.”\n\nSouth African President Jacob Zuma expressed his condolences, saying Masekela “kept the torch of freedom alive globally, fighting apartheid through his music and mobilizing international support for the struggle for liberation and raising awareness of the evils of apartheid … His contribution to the struggle for liberation will never be forgotten.”\n\nMasekela inspired generations of musicians in jazz and beyond and collaborated in recent years with South African house music DJ Black Coffee and others. “I have no words,” the DJ said Tuesday on Twitter.\n• Triller Pledges $4K A Month In Cash & Equity With New Program For Black Creators\n• The Weeknd Set To Co-Write, Produce & Star In New HBO Series ‘The Idol’\n\nGET THE HOTTEST STORIES STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX:",

        "articleBody": "La grotte Guattari dans le sud de Rome a révélé neuf squelettes néandertaliens : un ensemble exceptionnel. D'autant que des reliefs de repas complets ont été aussi mis à jour.\n\nCe matin, direction San Felice Circeo, au bord de la Méditerranée. J’ai vérifié : il fait un grand soleil ce matin et une vingtaine de degrés. Qu’allons-nous faire dans cette petite ville bénie des Dieux qui porte le nom même du bonheur ? Nous allons au fond d’une grotte.\n\nMais pas n’importe quelle grotte : la grotte de Guattari ! Depuis ce week-end, c’est même devenu LA grotte où être ! Le ministre italien de la culture, Dario Franceschini parle même \"d’un des sites les plus importants au monde pour l’histoire de l’humanité\".\n\nOn vient en effet d’y découvrir d’un coup non pas un, ni même deux ou trois, mais neuf squelettes de Néandertaliens ! Sept hommes, une femme et un petit garçon. Tous âgés de 50 à 68 000 ans ; sauf un qui a été daté de 90 à 100 000 ans.\n\nD’abord la grotte a été découverte il y a plus de 80 ans, en 1939, alors qu’on faisait des travaux autour d’un hôtel qui appartenait à un certain Guattari. D’où le nom de grotte Guattari. On y avait découvert à l’époque un crâne complet de Néandertalien.\n\nCe qui avait suffi à la renommée de ce coin d’Italie : l’hôtel avait été rebaptisé l’Hôtel Néandertal. Puis, plus rien : la grotte a été oubliée, l’hôtel a périclité et il est même aujourd’hui à vendre. Plus rien jusque fin 2019 où une nouvelle fouille est décidée.\n\nDes Néandertaliens et des (grosses) hyènes\n\nC’est le plus passionnant de cette histoire. Lorsqu’en 1939, on a trouvé le 1er crâne, on a remarqué qu’il portait un gros trou dans la tempe. Les archéologues de l’époque se sont mis à fantasmer à partir de l’idée que Néandertal était une brute épaisse.\n\nLeur conclusion ? Cannibalisme : ce crâne avait été évidé et son cerveau mangé comme un ris-de-veau. Sauf que nos archéologues d’aujourd’hui ont trouvé d’autre crânes percés de la même façon dans la grotte et leurs conclusions sont tout à fait différentes.\n\nLe ministère italien de la Culture l’espère et demande d’ailleurs l’aide de l’Europe pour mettre en valeur et protéger le site. Il faut savoir que, comme souvent en archéologie, on a eu beaucoup de chance.\n\nD’une part, ce site a été scellé dès la préhistoire par un éboulement et, d’autre part, son oubli après la découverte de 1939 a préservé son intégrité. Ce qui signifie qu’il peut être aujourd’hui étudié dans les règles de l’art. Alors, on y va au fond de la grotte ?",

        "articleBody": "Police released dramatic video showing the rescue of a 8-year-old Fort Worth girl who was ripped from her mother's arms and kidnapped in broad daylight. CBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was sentenced to life in federal prison.\n\nIn a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the kidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child's mother, he drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took the child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her into a room and held her captive.\n\nIt was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's room. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and hiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers, having visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\n\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort Worth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family friend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police Department responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the front passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into the hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry basket.\n\nThe video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and Webb eventually came out naked.\n\n\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in custody; we have her.\"\n\nFollowing a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth deliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping the girl.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she and her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother knocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\n\nThe victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and smart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical fight\" for her daughter's life.\n\n\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for and agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope is that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he will never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox.",

        "articleBody": "The latest wave of tech-based financial startups have a new angle on the banking sector: They’ll assume that everyone is out of money, then try to monetize their brokeness.\n\nSo-called neo-banks, or challenger banks, have been all the rage in Europe and Australia for the past few years. Now they’re starting to get attention here in the US, with names like Chime, Varo, SoFi, Current, GoBank, and even—heaven help us—booyah!. Yes, the exclamation point is part of the name. Like Yahoo!. Cutting edge, I know.\n\nThese neo-banks have been trying to make money in the usual ways: By taking a cut of credit or debit card transactions, collecting interest on consumer deposits, and making loans. The usual banking stuff.\n\nTheir come-on is that they’re super-convenient, all-digital, mobile alternatives to the big banks. Better yet, they’re focused on their customers’ “financial health,” as one neo-bank CEO told me, and easing the “pain” that people feel around their money.\n\nWhat makes that pain go away? At Chime and Varo, you can get what sounds a little like a neo–payday loan—your paycheck cashed, up to two days before your actual payday. Checking accounts at these startups are often free, and the companies will let you go $50 or $100 into the red before they start charging any overdraft fees. Some have automated savings accounts that invisibly funnel a few dollars from your paycheck into savings.\n\nThese neo-banks aren’t necessarily even banks at all; some are apps that facilitate transactions, which are then carried out by partners that are banks. Others have applied for bank charters while touting their homegrown technology stacks and hyperpersonalized product offerings (based, of course, on your personal data). But all of them say, explicitly or by intimation, that they’re mission-driven. Their mission is the hot mess that is your finances.\n\nThe hot mess is very real. Seventy-eight percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Student loan obligations in this country total $1.5 trillion, and researchers believe they’re cutting into millennials’ ability to buy homes, have kids, and save for retirement. More than 40 percent of households have some credit card debt: The average liability is more than $5,000, and the poorer you are, the more you’re likely to have.\n\nSo what better fix than to slap a slick veneer of tech over basic banking services, push the ouroboros paycheck cycle up by a couple of days, offer some basic budgeting tools, and call it a revolution in consumer banking?\n\nBetter banking isn’t a bad idea, nor is it a tough sell. There’s definitely an ambient frustration with the megabanks that have destroyed the global economy, bilked consumers with fake accounts and hidden terms, propped themselves up on the comfortable elbow of your overdraft fees, routinely discriminated against people of color, and on and on and on. I mean, there really should be a mission to take customers away from these companies. At minimum, it’s smart to capitalize on all of this well-earned consumer rage.",

        "articleBody": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday unveiled the first global geological map of Saturn's moon Titan including vast plains and dunes of frozen organic material and lakes of liquid methane, illuminating an exotic world considered a strong candidate in the search for life beyond Earth.\n\nThe map was based on radar, infrared and other data collected by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017. Titan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the Solar System's second-biggest moon behind Jupiter's Ganymede. It is larger than the planet Mercury.\n\n\"Organics are very important for the possibility of life on Titan, which many of us think likely would have evolved in the liquid water ocean under Titan's icy crust,\" said planetary geologist Rosaly Lopes of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\n\n\"Organic materials can, we think, penetrate down to the liquid water ocean and this can provide nutrients necessary for life, if it evolved there,\" added Lopes, who led the research published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nThe first global geologic map of Titan. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU)\n\nOn Earth, water rains down from clouds and fills rivers, lakes and oceans. On Titan, clouds spew hydrocarbons like methane and ethane - which are gases on Earth - in liquid form due to the moon's frigid climate.\n\nRainfall occurs everywhere on Titan, but the equatorial regions are drier than the poles, said study co-author Anezina Solomonidou, a European Space Agency research fellow.\n\nPlains (covering 65 percent of the surface) and dunes (covering 17 percent of the surface) made up of frozen bits of methane and other hydrocarbons dominate Titan's mid-latitudes and equatorial regions, respectively.\n\nTitan is the only Solar System object other than Earth boasting stable liquids on the surface, with lakes and seas of full of methane being major features at its polar regions. Hilly and mountainous areas, thought to represent exposed portions of Titan's crust of water ice, represent 14 percent of the surface.\n\n\"What is really fun to think about is if there are any ways that those more complex organics can go down and mix with water in the deep icy crust or deep subsurface ocean,\" JPL scientist and study co-author Michael Malaska said.\n\nNoting that on Earth there is a bacterium that can survive just on a hydrocarbon called acetylene and water, Malaska asked, \"Could it or something like it live in Titan deep in the crust or ocean where temperatures are a little warmer?\"\n\nThe map was created seven years before the US space agency is set to launch its Dragonfly mission to dispatch a multi-rotor drone to study Titan's chemistry and suitability for life. Dragonfly is scheduled to reach Titan in 2034.\n\n\"It is not only scientifically important but also really cool - a drone flying around on Titan,\" Lopes said. \"It will be really exciting.\"",

        "articleBody": "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, United Arab Emirates vice president and prime minister, center blue sandals, passes a Boeing Co. 787-10 passenger aircraft, operated by Emirates Airlines, during the 15th Dubai Air Show at Dubai World Central (DWC) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Monday, Nov. 13, 2017.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Dubai's flagship carrier Emirates Airline finalized a deal to purchase 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliner jets, executives of both companies announced Wednesday at the Dubai Air Show.\n\nThe deal sets up for a reduction to a prior commitment of 777x jets from the U.S. plane-maker, down by 30 to 126, which Emirates is opting for by employing its substitution rights. The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\n\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines.\n\nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\n\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline — the largest international carrier in the world — will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\n\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.\n\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.",

        "articleBody": "A \"phase one\" trade deal between the United States and China was supposed to be a limited agreement that would allow leaders from both countries to claim an easy victory while soothing financial markets.\n\nBut it may morph into something bigger if US President Donald Trump agrees to Beijing's demands to roll back existing tariffs on Chinese goods, people familiar with the talks say.\n\nChina's commerce ministry said this month that removing tariffs imposed during the trade war is an important condition to any deal. The demand has US officials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US farm goods, promises of improved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect intellectual property are enough to ask in return.\n\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.\n\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to see China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US maintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\n\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to campaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to voters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product purchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand dictate deals instead.\n\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from the 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and consumer goods.\n\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in annual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he would likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US put in place since the trade war started in 2018.\n\nTrump and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such concessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a second person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\n\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US on any deal, and hasn't committed to any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\n\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don't, that's it.\"\n\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an October news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could now be pushed into next year, trade experts say.",

        "articleBody": "Audi has revealed the second production model in its e-tron all-electric range, with the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback making its debut at the LA Auto Show. Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.\n\nIt’s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile.\n\nAt the front, there’s Audi’s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It’s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road – such as markings – with extra-precision.\n\nFor the rear, there’s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap.\n\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It’ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper.\n\nEurope will get the option of Audi’s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations.\n\nIn Europe, there’ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They’ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\n\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\n\nIt’ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to “S” and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It’s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds.\n\nQuattro is standard, and there’s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select – with seven different drive modes – will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches.\n\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It’s worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\n\nStill, there’ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\n\nFor Level 2 stations, there’ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge – which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in – will also be enabled in 2020.\n\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or “frunk,” you’re looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\n\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker’s twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There’ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\n\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi’s phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional.\n\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there’ll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it’ll also be used to control a new “functions on demand” system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis.\n\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\n\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback “edition one”: it’ll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\n\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year.",

        "articleBody": "After debuting the all-new Juke two months ago, Nissan has taken the covers off the eighth-generation Sentra. Featuring a new head-turning design that is paired to a more luxurious-looking cabin, the compact four-door has been redesigned from the ground-up and is more vibrant than ever.\n\nCrossovers may have become the vehicle of choice for most car buyers, but that doesn't mean the sedan is no longer relevant. In fact, Nissan still believes in sedans for their practicality, space, as well as looks.\n\n\"Nissan has a vibrant portfolio of new-generation sedans for customers in the U.S. Market. With more than 6 million Sentra vehicles sold, we believe the all-new Sentra will reach new heights offering refinement and quality, technology and performance not seen before. The lower stance and more athletic design cues from the Maxima sports sedan give Sentra a sexy new look,” said David Kershaw, division vice president, Nissan Sales & Regional Operations at Nissan North America Inc.\n\nTaking on a sleeker appearance, the 2020 Sentra gets a new V-Motion front grill that is complemented by a pair of eye-catching LED headlights. It also has a more sculpted hood which further accentuates the Sentra's sportier design. Wraparound taillights, meanwhile, give the sedan a sophisticated finish and are of the LED kind as well. A blacked roof along with five-spoke alloy wheels provide the 2020 Sentra an unmistakable look.\n\nInside, the Sentra's interior has been refined and is covered in high quality materials. The seats, the dashboard panel, as well as the steering wheel are all wrapped in fine leather. It also has contrast stitching which spruces up the overall look of the cabin. To improve riding comfort for the driver and front passenger, it has Nissan's NASA-inspired Zero Gravity Seats and come with a heated function.\n\nIn-car infotainment comes courtesy of an 8-inch touchscreen display. It comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Nissan Connect. It also doubles as a display for the Intelligent Around View Monitor which allows for safer parking / maneuvering.\n\nAn all-new 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine replaces the previous 1.8-liter from before. It puts out 151 PS along with 197 Nm of torque; which Nissan claims is a 20% and 16% improvement respectively compared to the older engine. Besides having more oomph, Nissan said that the new 2.0-liter will deliver better fuel efficiency.\n\nA bevy of active and passive safety features are available on the 2020 Sentra. These include 10 airbags, rear door alert, intelligent forward collision warning, as well as intelligent driver awareness. Aside from those, driver assist systems such as automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, and high beam assist are also available on the 2020 Sentra.\n\nThe all-new sedan is set to go on sale in the US in late January. As to when will this arrive in the Philippines, we're not entirely sure yet. However, since the Sylphy already debuted in China last April 2019, maybe it's only a matter of time before it gets to the ASEAN region. Who knows, maybe its next appearance will be at the 2020 Bangkok International Motor Show which might signal its arrival to the Philippine market some time next year.",

        "articleBody": "Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen went under the knife for a routine surgery in 2009. Hours later, she woke up as a different person — and became a great songwriter.\n\nThe bizarre odyssey of how Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen came to co-write the euphoric power-ballad that Jessie Buckley performs at the end of “Wild Rose” — easily the year’s best original movie song — began 10 years ago, when the “Melvin and Howard” star woke up after a minor arm surgery feeling like her mind was on fire.\n\n“I felt strange as soon as the anesthesia started to wear off,” Steenburgen said. “The best way I can describe it is that it just felt like my brain was only music, and that everything anybody said to me became musical. All of my thoughts became musical. Every street sign became musical. I couldn’t get my mind into any other mode.”\n\nFun as that might sound in an Oliver Sacks kind of way — the late neurologist wrote about similar, potentially stroke-inspired symptoms in his book “Musicophilia” — Steenburgen wasn’t thrilled about the sudden mental shift. The next two months were tough. “I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t have acted,” she said. “I couldn’t have learned any lines. My husband [actor Ted Danson] and I were kind of frightened about it.”\n\nSteenburgen’s son, filmmaker Charlie McDowell (“The Discovery,” “The One I Love”), also remembers it as a trying time. “If your mom comes to you after surgery and says that her head is now full of music, I think it’s totally fair to think that she’s gone crazy and has major psychological problems,” he said. “All of a sudden she was referencing these obscure indie bands and picking up random instruments — I’m not gonna lie, the accordion playing drives me nuts,” McDowell laughed. “When I say all this out loud it sounds insane. It was definitely a change.”\n\nDespite the paucity of roles for women in their mid-50s, the actress wasn’t exactly itching to do something else. “I had been somebody who really liked music,” she said, “but I had never been obsessed with it; I was obsessed with acting, and that felt like a big enough subject for me.”\n\nWhen the music didn’t go away, Steenburgen realized that she had to do something with it — if only for her sanity — even though she didn’t know how to play an instrument. “I called a very talented friend of mine on Martha’s Vineyard and I said: ‘Look, if I come over every day and sing what I hear in my head, could you help me make them into songs?’” she said. She wrote hundreds of songs that summer and sent 12 of the best ones to a music lawyer under her mother’s name. “He wanted to work with ‘Nellie Wall,’ but then I showed up instead,” she said.\n\nThe next thing she knew, Steenburgen had been signed to Universal as a songwriter and was on a plane to Nashville. It was the first stride on a strange path that would eventually lead to Tom Harper and Jessie Buckley’s doorstep almost a decade later.\n\nFlash-forward to 2017, when Harper — a young British filmmaker hot off directing a lush BBC adaptation of “War & Peace” — had just found his next project. He’d fallen in love with an electric Nicole Taylor script called “Wild Rose,” a fish-out-of-water story about a self-destructive Glaswegian country singer and single mom whose only dream in life is to sing Patsy Cline ballads at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry. Buckley — who landed a key role in “War & Peace” after surging to fame on the U.K. singing competition “I’d Do Anything” — had agreed to play Rose-Lynn Harlan, and Harper knew in his bones that she was perfect for the part.\n\nThere was just one problem: The climactic song that ties the whole movie together didn’t exist. The script called for a soaring, original anthem that Rose-Lynn belts to a loving hometown crowd in the very last scene after she’s learned to reconcile her dreams with her reality in a way that makes them both feel a little more special, but no details. Phoning in from London, Harper remembered the anxiety of moving forward without that crucial missing piece: “The script just said something along the lines of, ‘Rose-Lynn sings an incredible song and it conveys everything that she wants to express to her mom and kids and everyone’s uplifted. The end,’” Harper said. “I had faith that we could figure it out, but it was really worrying.” Universal’s music division provided some demos, but none of them clicked.\n\nAt the last minute, a sample came in called “Glasgow (“No Place Like Home”). “It grabbed me by the heart the moment I heard it,” he said. “It just connected.” Buckley, who phoned in from the Chicago set of “Fargo,” had a similar experience: “It was just that immediate feeling of ‘this is the song.’”\n\nThat’s when Harper and Buckley first learned who had written it, and found themselves blindsided by “the Mary Steenburgen of it all.”\n\nAs it turned out, Steenburgen had spent the last few years toiling away on her own dream of making it in Music City. And despite the many advantages that her fame might have afforded her, she was more nervous about going there than Rose-Lynn Harlan has ever been about anything. “It was terrifying,” she said. “The first session I did was a total disaster, and I literally went back to my hotel room in tears, cried my eyes out, and thought ‘Why would anyone be so stupid at age 54 to think they could do something so new?’”\n\nBut she also felt like she didn’t have much of a choice. “I was back at it by the next morning,” she said. “I just told myself: ‘I’m going to go right up and sing the bleeping song if it kills me!’” Not long after that, Steenburgen bought a house in Nashville.\n\nMcDowell still laughs at the memory of hearing his mom spontaneously begin to scat in the backseat of his car. “It could have been really easy for Mary Steenburgen to just put her name on something and get a pass on many of the usual steps in some new creative thing, but she didn’t do that,” she said. “She put in the time to learn the craft, and I respect that. And I have to admit, she’s gotten really good at the accordion.”\n\nSteenburgen’s career experience also gave her a unique advantage over the competition: While most of the songwriters who submitted demos for “Wild Rose” were content to read a plot synopsis and work in broad strokes from there, Steenburgen approached the assignment as if the song were a character for her to play. “I fought to get the full script, because I just felt like I was looking at such a small part of the story without it,” she said. “Where does Rose-Lynn live? What does her apartment look like? I needed to think of imagery that might be cohesive with what the production designer, the cinematographer, and the composer would be doing; there are all these people you haven’t met yet who are telling the same story. And as soon as I read the whole thing, I understood what we were writing.”\n\nThat process led to a realization: “It was a really love song from Rose-Lynn to her mother …It was also a love song to her city and a love song to the concept of home and the fact that home doesn’t have to be second best for her or something that she settles for.”\n\nBoth accomplished songwriters who had previously written music for the television show “Nashville,” Steenburgen’s co-writers Caitlyn Smith and Kate York came to the project with a similar appreciation for the challenge of writing character-driven chords. “It’s a totally different muscle,” York said. “You have to take yourself out of it a little bit — it’s kind of like acting, I guess.” Smith agreed: “It’s a different job altogether. If you’re just writing a song for someone else, it’s wide open and sometimes hard to figure out. And if you’re writing for yourself, you’re really digging into your own heart.” This particular task was a little bit of both. “I feel like we could get into the guts of this song because we’ve all lived a similar crazy dream story,” Smith said.\n\nThe first thing they found out is that Rose-Lynn worships Patsy Cline, and so the three writers knew they had to craft something with classic country DNA (not an obvious assumption in a film that builds to a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo from a genre-bending superstar like Kacey Musgraves). Smith seized on something with a 6/8 feel, and they all decided to stay there. But the songwriters also reckoned with the role that Glasgow plays in Rose-Lynn’s life, and not just as an albatross around her neck.\n\n“Anything we wrote had to have a fond hint of Scotland,” Steenburgen said. “So I called one of my best friends, a Scottish woman who started out as a nanny and ended up like a sister,” a detail that dovetails eerily well with the plot of the film. “So I called her up and said ‘Talk to me in your accent — talk to me about you.’ And through that we wound up with images like the opening line: ‘I’ve worn out the stones in front of your doorstep.’”\n\nThe entire song went from a dream to a demo in just a few short hours — which, when you listen to “Glasgow,” seems as crazy as the story that led Steenburgen to co-write it. “It may sound shallow or like it’s a factory when I talk about how fast we write these things,” Steenburgen said, “but I always think of it like this: ‘I can’t take days to do a scene.’ I can’t say ‘I don’t know what the emotion is for the character, so can you give me until tomorrow?’ I’m always having to tell stories on a time limit.” Steenburgen has only found one drawback to collaborating with Smith and York: “They’re such good singers that people are going to get intimidated by their demos and go, ‘Well I can’t sing like that, so I’m not doing that song.’”\n\n1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right\n\nBuckley, who hadn’t sung in a long time before the production, worried about doing justice to a song like “Glasgow,” especially given that she had no background in country music. “But the story of it really moved me,” she said, “so I sat down with a guitarist in a room and sang it really badly and just tried to attach some emotional feeling to it before we started filming.”\n\nBy the time Buckley learned who had written the song, she was only half-surprised: “It made sense, because it clearly came from someone with a complex understanding of character — someone who was able to kind of go right to the root of what this woman’s story is about, and managed to write lyrics that exposed the cracks under the surface,” she said.\n\nWhile Buckley own story feels something like a fairy tale come true, she drew a distinction with her character. “I told her my secrets and she told me hers and we built a different person together,” she said. “‘Glasgow’ is a song of belonging. It’s about stretching yourself to places that you don’t know are within yourself.” For the first time in a long time, Buckley had something to sing about. “This song was such a gift to me,” she said. In turn, it also became her gift to the women who wrote it.\n\nSteenburgen called Buckley’s performance “stunning,” but seemed changed by the experience in a fundamentally different way than everyone else involved. “Music is in my genes thanks to the women in my family, and I just think I was somehow granted access to it,” she said. “It was so overwhelming for me in the beginning because I didn’t grow up with having that voice in my head, like Kate and Caitlyn did.”\n\nThe barnstormer of a song that Rose-Lynn performs in the film’s last scene conveys the ache and discovery of her journey from prison to paradise. It begins with Buckley’s voice cresting through an ocean of silence, as Rose-Lynn summons the strength to confront her regrets until they resolve into love. She apologizes to her family, her children, and the entire life she tried to escape: “I pushed you away, put a pin in a map, then I got lost in the storm.”\n\nA faint lilt begins to hum behind her, peeking through the lyrics like the first ray of sunshine after a squall: It’s an accordion, lighting Rose-Lynn’s way towards a place she never could have imagined before. “Had to find my own way, make my own mistakes, but you know that I had to go,” she sings. “Ain’t no yellow brick road running through Glasgow, but I found one that’s stronger than stone.”\n\nAnd then Rose-Lynn hits the chorus with the sweet relief of someone who’s tunneled their way to freedom, as Buckley’s voice swells from low to high and back again. She sings on behalf of anyone who’s ever had to learn about themselves the hard way: “Ain’t no place like home,” she and Rose-Lynn sing together, and as the song becomes so big that it envelopes them both, along with all the Glaswegian extras who packed into Celtic Connections for the 12-hour shoot, and everyone in the audience. It’s staggering.\n\nIt’s also not the happy ending that Rose-Lynn imagined for herself. And yet, happiness often looks different from how you saw it in your head. When Steenburgen’s life took an unexpected detour, it felt like fate (or a weird quirk of anatomy) was forcing her to choose between the dream she’d had since she was just a starry-eyed girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the strange new reality that had ambushed her in a hospital one night. To hear it from her now, it sounds like she’s found a beautiful harmony between the two.\n\n“I didn’t fall out of love with acting when this happened,” Steenburgen said, “and I still haven’t. But there’s so much more capability in our brains than we probably realize, and agreeing to diminishment and shutting down doors is a choice that we all make for ourselves. It turns out you don’t really have to do that.”\n\n“Wild Rose” is now available on DVD and VOD.\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

        "articleBody": "Enter South Dakota to throw down the gauntlet. The state’s new slogan for an anti-drug campaign drew a South Dakota-sized share of attention on social media Monday.\n\nJust what is this priceless slogan?\n\nYes, that’s it. No joke. The governor of South Dakota would like us to know that her state is on meth. You know, like solving the problem. On it!\n\nOf course, you might just be able to see the issue here, besides the fact that Florida Man will have to up the ante next time.\n\nAnd if you haven’t yet noticed what might be wrong, a whole lot of people on Twitter pointed it out.\n\nSo many people were talking about South Dakota’s odd new slogan that the state and “We’re On It\" became top Twitter trends.\n\nAccording to a report in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, Gov. Kristi Noem launched the campaign on Monday in an effort to address the state’s meth crisis.\n\n“Meth. We’re on it” is rolling out with TV commercials and billboards in which people say, “I’m on meth.”\n\nThe report says the Minneapolis ad agency Broadhead Co. came up with the campaign, and the state has paid the agency nearly $449,000 so far this year.\n\nNoem saw the Twitter reaction and ... doubled down on the slogan.\n\n“Hey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness,” Noem tweeted. “So I think that’s working.”\n\nShe proceeded to share the hashtag #MethWeAreOnIt and onmeth.com, the website for the initiative, which contains the following statement:\n\n“South Dakota has a problem. There isn’t a single solution because meth is widespread. But we can approach it from different angles, so it doesn’t take over counties, towns, neighborhoods. Let’s work together. Meth. We’re on it.”\n\nStill, this isn’t the first time a slogan has gone awry in South Dakota.\n\nConsider this 2014 entry — “Don’t jerk and drive,\" meant to discourage drivers from jerking the wheels of their cars while traveling on icy roads.\n\nThe road safety slogan was an intentional play for a double entendre, but drew enough criticism to get the ax from the state Department of Public Safety.\n\nHave a tip?

        "articleBody": "This post may contain affiliate or referral links. Please see our full affiliate disclosure here.\n\nThis holiday season I was thinking of flavors that would put me in the holiday spirit when it came to me. Not to be confused with a 1990s grunge band, pear jam is a delicious gift to give for the holidays. With notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove, this honey pear jam recipe will have you spreading Yuletide cheer in no time! It’s so easy and delicious that you’ll want to make some extra for yourself!\n\nIs there anything better than a piece of toast or a biscuit topped with a dollop of jam? Especially homemade jam. Not many things are more homey and comforting than jam that has been made in someone’s kitchen. Up until not too long ago, I used to think that people who made their own jam must be wizards. Jam has always seemed like one of those things that only other people made, and then I tried it. Honestly, it’s so easy that anyone can do it with a few simple ingredients and not much equipment.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE JAM\n\nDo you make jam in a pot? A pressure canner? I don’t know. Help!\n\nThe simple answer is that foods with low acidity need to be canned in a pressure canner. For this jam, though, all you need is an inexpensive water bath canner with a rack. A water bath canner is really just a big porcelain stockpot that will hold about ten canning jars depending on their size. They also come with a rack that makes removing your jars easier and keeps them from coming in contact with the bottom of the canner.\n\nIn addition to the canner pot, you will need some mason jars (I prefer 8-ounce jelly jars), a ladle, and something to remove the hot jars from boiling water. You could get creative or just use a jar lifter which is a nifty set of tongs made specifically to fit over mason jars.\n\nNow that you have your equipment, you will need the ingredients. About 8 ripe pears, a fresh lemon, fruit pectin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves, and a 16-ounce Don Victor® Orange Blossom Comb Honey Globe Jar. Before getting your jam mixture ready, fill your canner to the line on the inside and set it to simmer. Add your jelly jars and let them get warm while you make your jam.\n\nCube and peel the pears with a paring knife and put them in a large pot. To the pears, add the juice of one lemon and spices. Stir together and taste test it to make sure your flavors are where you want them to be before adding the fruit pectin powder. Heat to boiling for a minute or so to combine the spices and pears, then add a jar Don Victor® Honey, or about a cup and a half. Let the mixture boil until thickened on the back of a spoon, or about 5-8 minutes.\n\nHOW TO USE A WATER BATH CANNER\n\nWhen your jam mixture is the correct consistency, use a ladle to transfer the mixture into the warm and sterilized jelly jars. I may or may not have been going a little too fast and spilled some hot jam on my hand. I don’t recommend that, so please pour slowly and carefully.\n\nNow that your jars are filled, put the tops on, lower the rack into the canner, and use your jar lifter to lower the jars into the water one at a time. Turn the stove up from simmering to boil the jars for *10 minutes. If you live at an altitude of more than 1000 feet as I do, you will need to adjust your boiling time. There are altitude charts available online. We are at 5280 feet in Denver so I boiled mine for 20 minutes.\n\nRemove the jars from the boiling water and let them cool for several hours. If your jam looks runny, don’t worry. It will thicken as it cools. It could take 24-48 hours to really look like jam.\n\nIf you choose to gift your honey pear jam to friends and family, there are so many ways you can present your gift. Make cute labels, put it in a gift basket, or add a piece of fabric and a ribbon to dress up the jar and pass them out to your friends and family. No matter how you choose to present your gift, it’s sure to be a winner.\n\nDecorating the top of your jelly jars with fabric is super simple. Cut a piece of fabric in a circle to use as a cover for your jelly jars and fasten with a ribbon to make them extra festive. Set them aside in a pretty basket if you wish, ready to hand out to your friends, family, and coworkers.\n\nUSING HONEY INSTEAD OF SUGAR\n\nI like to use honey because it has more flavor than sugar. In general, when substituting honey for sugar in a recipe you will use about half the amount. For instance, the original recipe for this jam called for three cups of sugar, but I only use a cup and a half of honey.\n\nBoth the pear jam and honey are a delicious addition to toast, biscuits, or homemade vanilla scones.\n\nYou may also like:",

        "articleBody": "NASA’s sights are set on landing on our moon and Mars, but Jupiter’s moon Europa may have the ingredients for life.\n\nWashington, DC, United States – Getting to the moon, while not easy, has been done. Staying on the moon and reaching Mars, however, haven not. Why? Because space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\n\nIt is for that reason that the United States‘s space agency NASA on Monday enlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space industry’s upstarts – Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX among them – to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon shot.\n\n“We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had enhanced lander capabilities,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference call with media.\n\n“This is based on our objectives, the agency’s objectives, to get to the moon as soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human exploration standpoint,” he said.\n\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for contracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments, and to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed\n\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA’s Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical schedule delays “. The report and Monday’s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency’s 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\n\nIn May, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expand ed to Jupiter’s moon Europa, as NASA’s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moon’s icy crust.\n\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life – chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water – are on Europa.\n\nCloser to home, NASA’s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth’s moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions – Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX – are notable for not having been on last year’s original list.\n\n“We’re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. “It’s very exciting times. We’re using our Blue moon lander, which is [a] big one.”\n\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\n\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics Inc and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery – indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\n“Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,” said Michael Sims, CEO and founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\n“There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players. And we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity that adds to the mix.”",

        "articleBody": "Braid creator Jonathan Blow's latest game, the well-received puzzle game The Witness, won't be heading to Nintendo Switch, it seems. Blow told Eurogamer that there are no plans currently to port the 2016 game to Switch, but he has a never say never attitude about it. If it were to happen, Blow would likely outsource the project to a different studio because his team is too busy.\n\n\"I wouldn't say never,\" Blow said about the possibility of The Witness coming to Nintendo Switch. \"But we worked on that game for a long time. We could have done more ports but I felt like it was a good idea to give the team a break and work on some new things.\"\n\n\"We're working on new projects now. We're not really working on ports of The Witness but that could change,\" he said. \"Something could happen. We could outsource it and quality control in-house. But we're not currently doing anything.\"\n\nThe Witness was originally released in January 2016 for PS4 and PC, before coming to Xbox One later that year. An iOS edition was released in 2017.\n\nThe Switch is selling really well, so there may come a time when the installed base of the hybrid console is too big to ignore, but it seems it's not at that point yet.\n\nBlow's current project is a game codenamed Sokoban. It's still early days, but Blow sums it up thusly, \"It's weird. It's a level-based game. There's a lot of levels. We have a lot more levels than we had last year.\"\n\nBlow is one of two programmers on the game, while five artists are also on the team. In addition to that work, Blow is apparently creating a new programming language for it, which may explain why it's taking some time. You can watch Blow's presentation from Gamelab in the video embedded above to learn more about Sokoban.",

        "articleBody": "Somebody, please just snap a football.\n\nIt seems like a relentless wave of controversy, scandal, even death, followed us at every turn in the offseason.\n\nNow it's finally time to play -- and speculate. Pencil in Alabama and Clemson already? Is the game's best player a defender? Does the Pac-12 have a chance?\n\nCollege football needs to start celebrating itself after this troubling offseason. The sport is one year short of turning 150. Believe me, you'll read, hear and watch enough about that leading up to Nov. 6, 2019.\n\nFor now, here are 18 things you need to keep an eye on ahead the 2018 season.\n\n1. A relentless Tide: History awaits. Nick Saban goes for a record-breaking seventh national championship -- his sixth at Alabama -- this season. Seven would separate him from Bear Bryant for most titles won. A lot of us think Saban has achieved his own orbit already.\n\nWe are most likely living through the greatest dynasty of all-time. The SEC has never been better. Recruiting has never been more cutthroat. Saban has redefined strategy, work ethic and the game itself.\n\nHe deftly handled the transfer of quarterback Jalen Hurts that never happened. Somehow, a junior with a national championship ring and 26-2 record as a starter may end up being the backup this season. The assumption is that Alabama gets stronger if Tua Tagovailoa snags the job.\n\nThe Crimson Tide were the last team to grab a spot in the College Football Playoff and won only after trusting the championship game to Tua, a true freshman, at halftime. If that's backsliding, everyone would love to experience that type of weakness.\n\nAlabama is the favorite again this year, but there is a familiar challenger on the horizon …\n\n2. Clemson, too (or is it \"two?\"): Maybe the discussion shouldn't be about Alabama but a Clemson team chasing its second title in three years. Dabo Swinney has Clemson at one of the peaks in its history. This season, the Tigers could become the first ACC team to win four straight outright conference titles. The defensive line is historic. The quarterback depth is excellent. It will be an upset if Clemson and Alabama don't meet for a third straight season in the CFP.\n\n3. Choke hold: OK, assuming the Tide and Tigers are in, Cinderella's dress is in tatters. That's another way of saying the list of championship contenders is a small one. There's a group of 8-10 teams that can realistically win it all. Start with four from the Big Ten: Wisconsin, Ohio State, Penn State and Michigan. Continue with the SEC: Alabama, Auburn and Georgia. Add Clemson, and you've probably read this year's Football Four already in this paragraph.\n\n4. So who makes it to the CFP then? The winners will meet Jan. 7 in Santa Clara, California.\n• Orange Bowl: No. 1 Alabama vs. No. 4 Wisconsin\n• Cotton Bowl: No. 2 Clemson vs. No. 3 Georgia\n\n\n\n5. Urban Meyer's legacy: Right now, it is damaged. One of the greatest coaches of this era was suspended last week in a moral and ethical crisis that won't go away anytime soon. Any summary of Meyer's career now has to include the assertion Ohio State's coach overlooked an alleged domestic abuser in the name of winning games.\n\nFor a legion of Bucknuts, Meyer's three-game suspension is too much. For others, it will define who he is as a man and coach. Questions about the veracity of the investigation will continue to linger, but if history is an indicator, football at Ohio State has always been bigger than the Ohio State football coach. Regardless of the fallout, the Buckeyes will keep winning. Big.\n\n6. Player safety: Two investigations are active at Maryland determining the circumstances surrounding Jordan McNair's death. The school has taken responsibility for his passing. That's a start. An ESPN report detailed a \"toxic culture\" of training within the Maryland program.\n\nIt points to a larger issue in college football. The sport continues to put too much value in punitive training measures over a performance-based approach. The mentality goes back to the no-water days of Vince Lombardi and beyond.\n\nIt must end. Since 2000, almost 30 college football players have died. The overwhelming majority of them were in T-shirts and shorts -- practicing football, not playing, when they were stricken. Football has a problem with player safety. More must be done than what looks like the likely firing of Maryland coach DJ Durkin.\n\n7. Betting on a new era: College administrators are freaking about the new era of sports gambling. They don't quite know how to deal with one of their 21-year-old athletes legally placing a bet on a game but getting suspended for breaking NCAA rules. A handful of states will have sportsbooks open in time for the season. The concern is whether legal sports gambling makes it more or less likely that funny stuff (game-fixing, point-shaving) will be going on.\n\n8. Herm Edwards: I'm through asking, \"Why?\" I'm ready to say, \"Why not?\" … when it comes to Arizona State's Grand Experiment. Everything else has failed in Tempe, so why not take a chance on a 63-year-old former TV analyst who has never been a college head coach.\n\n9. After Baker: Quarterback Kyler Murray was surprisingly taken in the top 10 of the MLB Draft in June. The Oakland A's are allowing him play a final year of football before Murray (supposedly) goes full-time to baseball. Possibly dumb for the A's if Murray blows out a knee. Great for the Sooners and Murray, who gets the best of both worlds. No pressure, kid. Murray is replacing the Heisman Trophy winner and expected to help win a fourth consecutive Big 12 title while leading the Sooners to another playoff berth.\n\n10. The Tom Mars Effect: Add the name of the Arkansas attorney to the list of the most influential figures in college football. The former director of Arkansas State Police and Wal-Mart general counsel has become one of the smartest people in the room wielding power behind the scenes.\n\nStart with the Houston Nutt lawsuit that led to the resignation of Hugh Freeze last year at Ole Miss. That, in turn, led to transfer waiver requests by six Ole Miss players handled by Mars. All of them have earned their immediate eligibility for 2018.\n\nLately, Texas A&M is under NCAA scrutiny because of Santino Marchiol's transfer appeal led by Mars. If Michigan wins the Big Ten, Mars deserves a slice of the trophy. His dogged appeal on behalf of Shea Patterson led to Jim Harbaugh getting the difference-making quarterback he never had at Michigan. Mars has at once become an athlete advocate, watchdog and power broker.\n\n11. The SEC is back on top: With two teams in the title game last year and a number of new coaches joining the league, the SEC has regained its standing in the conference power rankings.\n• SEC: Six deep, at least.\n• Big Ten: The East might be the toughest division in the game.\n• Big 12: Oklahoma is favored again. West Virginia or TCU is No. 2. Is Texas back?\n• ACC: Clemson is boat-racing the league. Hard to believe the Tigers play one currently-ranked team (Oct. 27, No. 19 Florida State)\n• Pac-12: The league went 1-8 in bowl games. Get back in the playoff, and we'll talk. \n\n\n\n\n\n12. First coach to get fired: Kansas' David Beaty is 3-33 in three seasons. He has a new athletic director in Jeff Long, formerly at Arkansas. If the Jayhawks win two this season, it would be considered improvement. If not during the season, shortly thereafter it seems Beaty will be let go. Here are the candidates.\n\n13. Most successful new coach: With apologies to Chip Kelly (UCLA) and Jimbo Fisher (Texas A&M), it has to be Joe Moorhead at Mississippi State in 2018. Moorhead has been gifted 16 starters. For nine years under Dan Mullen, the Bulldogs have played \"up.\" That should continue under Moorhead, who gets to work his offensive magic with Heisman Trophy candidate Nick Fitzgerald at quarterback. Mullen will get a shot at this title, too, taking over at Florida.\n\n14. Most likely to be shown to the hot seat: How many European capitals will Michigan visit before Jim Harbaugh beats Ohio State? OK, that's another way of saying that it's put up or shut up time for Harbaugh. Michigan's coach has his best team in his in his fourth season in Ann Arbor. There is a quarterback (Patterson), a stout defense and expectations out the wazoo.\n\nHarbaugh can stage all the overseas spring practices he wants (Italy and France have been conquered so far). It's getting noticeable he is 1-5 against Michigan State and Ohio State. Oh, and there is that trip to blood rival Notre Dame this week to kick off the season. (And for the record, Harbs, London, Munich, Geneva and Oslo are still out there for you.)\n\n15. God bless Bill Snyder: Kansas State's forever coach will turn 79 in October. That's just the beginning for the man who fashioned the Manhattan Miracle. The game's oldest coach recently received a contract extension that will take him to age 83 in 2022. That would make him the oldest coach in college football since one Joe Paterno was fired at age 84 in 2011. Snyder still hopes to have input in naming his eventual replacement -- special teams coach and son Sean Snyder.\n\n16. Repairing Tennessee's rep, psyche and program: After a protracted, ugly process, Jeremy Pruitt finally replaced Butch Jones in Knoxville. In between, Tennessee football made headlines for all the wrong reasons. The school could have produced a training film for how not to conduct a coaching search.\n\nAthletic director Phillip Fulmer finally hired a coach in his image. Pruitt will the run the ball and play defense. How quickly he does both those things well will determine if Tennessee has changed coaches or actually changed directions.\n\n17. Best player in the country vs. Heisman winner: The best player is Will Grier. West Virginia's quarterback has all the weapons to throw at least 40 touchdowns this season. His best receivers are back. His defense is sub-par. The combination means Grier and the Mountaineers will have to outscore everyone. Stanford's Bryce Love has to be the Heisman favorite. On a healthy ankle, Love will rush for 2,000 yards and become the school's second Heisman winner.\n\nRemember, there frequently is a difference between the best player and Heisman winner. Voters usually put candidates in a box: They must be skill players on a 10-win team (or better) who do something dramatic in November. There is definitely that difference this season.\n\n18. The Group of Five playoff hope: Remember the Broncos? Boise State should be the Group of Five champion that gets the automatic New Year's Six berth (Fiesta or Peach Bowl this year). But given their reputation -- one of the original BCS busters -- can the Broncos snag a playoff berth? Yeah, it's a longshot. As far as schedule strength goes, their only Power Five opponent is Oklahoma State.\n\nIn coach Bryan Harsin's fifth year, Boise seems loaded enough to make an undefeated run similar to UCF. And we know what happened to the Knights. The NCAA just recognized their 2017 national championship claim.\n\nGosh, will Bama have to \"share\" the natty again?",

        "articleBody": "Sebelum Islam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah zaman Khalifah Ali karena pemberontakan Mu’awiyah di tahun 37 Hijriyah. 26 tahun setelah wafatnya Nabi. Islam sudah sempurna secara aqidah mau pun fiqih. Islam sudah sempurna sebelum Nabi Muhammad SAW wafat. Jadi baik Sunni dan Syiah yg sebagian besar sahabat Nabi itu aqidah dan ibadahnya sama: Islam.\n\nZaman Sahabat itu zaman terbaik Islam. Karena Islam saat itu sudah sempurna dan amat murni. Masih banyak orang2 yg melihat langsung amal ibadah Nabi, ngobrol bersama Nabi, berjuang bersama Nabi. Sementara kita di akhir zaman ini belum tentu benar karena sudah diselubungi fitnah.\n\nIslam pecah jadi Sunni dan Syi’ah karena faktor politik. Karena kekuasaan. Pendukung Ali disebut Syiah Ali yg kemudian disebut Syiah saja. Pendukung Muawiyah dan yg netral disebut Sunni.\n\nSetelah pecah itulah jalan sendiri2.\n\nImam Ja’far Ash Shadiq yg merupakan guru dari Imam Malik dan Imam Abu Hañifah membentuk Mazhab Ja’fari. Imam Malik yg merupakan guru dari Imam Syafi’ie membentuk mazhab Maliki. Imam Abu Hanifah membentuk mazhab Hanafi. Imam Syafi’ie guru dari Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Syafi’ie. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal membentuk mazhab Hanbali. Mereka semua punya hubungan guru dan murid.\n\nDari sini juga perawi hadits Sunni dan Syiah jalan sendiri2. Imam Kulayni bikin kitab hadits Al Kafi. Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim dsb bikin kitab Shahih Bukhari, Shahih Muslim dsb. Sebagian perawi haditsnya dari Syiah bahkan di Rijalul Hadits ada yg disebut Rafidhi karena tak membolehkan orang bernama Mu’awiyah masuk ke rumahnya.\n\nAda juga percampuran Ilmu misalnya orang Syiah belajar dari ulama Sunni dan orang Sunni belajar dari ulama Syiah. Contoh kitab Subulus Salam yg biasa diajarkan di pesantren2 NU ternyata disusun oleh ulama Syiah.\n\nCuma sekali lagi zaman Nabi Islam sudah sempurna. Jadi saat para sahabat pecah jadi Sunni dan Syiah, Islam mereka sudah sempurna meski saat itu mazhab fiqih dan kitab2 hadits belum ditulis.\n\nJadi keliru karena Syiah beda dgn Sunni langsung dibilang bukan Islam. Pelajari dulu sejarah Islam dari berbagai sumber. Bukan dgn 1 mata.⁠⁠\n\nSebelumnya kita tegaskan bahwa menghina istri Nabi Siti ‘Aisyah ra dan menghina Khulafaur Rosyidiin seperti Abu Bakar ra, Umar bin Khoththob ra, Usman bin Affan ra, dan Ali bin Abi Talib ra adalah perbuatan yang sesat. Harusnya dapat sanksi hukum misalnya 10 tahun penjara atau lebih berat lagi.\n\nSyi’ah Rafidhoh yang gemar menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi seperti Yasir Habib dan Tawhidi ternyata dipelihara Zionis Yahudi untuk memecah-belah Islam. Video Yasir Habib saat syahadah sering disebar ole Wahabi. Untuk menimbulkan kemarahan dan perang sesama Islam tentunya. Yasir Habib ternyata dipelihara London dan diberi dana untuk bikin Fadak TV. Tawhidi yang sekarang diundang ke Indonesia oleh Emilia Renita dari Oase dipelihara oleh Australia. Gunanya untuk membuat Indonesia kacau.\n\nBukan cuma istri dan sahabat Nabi yang dihina oleh Rafidhi macam Yasir Habib. Bahkan Imam tertinggi Syi’ah pun seperti Ali Khamenei mereka hina karena mengharamkan penghinaan tsb.\n\nPresiden Ahmadinejad menandaskan, “Dari tribun ini saya tegaskan bahwa barang siapa di mana pun ia berada menghina sahabat Rasulullah saw, maka ia bukanlah seorang muslim dan tidak bergerak di atas jalan Islam. Ia tidak lebih hanyalah kaki tangan dan alat mainan musuh-musuh asing.”\n\nSekarang kita lihat asal muasal penghinaan terhadap istri dan sahabat Nabi.\n\nSaya dulu merasa kehidupan semua sahabat rukun dan damai. Itu benar di zaman Nabi. Saat Nabi wafat, timbul perdebatan siapa yang berhak menjadi pemimpin ummat Islam sebagai Nabi. Kaum Syi’ah umumnya berpendapat Ali berhak menjadi Khalifah. Sementara mayoritas sahabat mengangkat Abu Bakar ra sebagai Khalifah. Suka tidak suka, semua sahabat membai’at Abu Bakar sebagai Khalifah. Termasuk Ali.\n\nSaat Ali jadi khalifah, Siti ‘Aisyah memberontak dalam perang yang disebut Perang Jamal yang menewaskan 17.000 orang. Saat Mu’awiyah berontak dalam perang Siffin pun ada 70.000 Muslim yang tewas. Dari pihak Ali 25.000 orang yang tewas. Dari pihak Mu’awiyah, 45.000 orang yang tewas.\n\nNah kalau para sahabat ini saling bunuh dalam Perang Jamal dan Perang Siffin, tentu diawali dengan perang lisan dan juga tulisan. Saling hina. Bisa jadi tulisan2 yang mengina sampai ke kita hingga sekarang. Ini mirip saat Pilpres 2014 antara Jokowi melawan Prabowo di mana masing2 pengikut menghina yang lain. Bahkan Jokowi difitnah sebagai kafir sehingga keluarlah foto2 Jokowi sedang sholat.\n\nItulah asal muasal penghinaan istri dan sahabat Nabi. Itu satu lembaran hitam sejarah yang harusnya kita tutup. Menghina istri dan sahabat Nabi yg dilakukan sebagian kaum Syi’ah dan menghina orang tua Nabi yg dilakukan Wahabi itu dosa besar. Cuma kalau taubat dan pemimpinnya mengharamkannya, ya selesai. Allah Maha Pengampun.\n\nManusia itu sifatnya salah dan lupa. Sebaik2 orang salah adalah orang yang taubat. Nabi Adam dan Nabi Yunus pun pernah salah, tapi begitu tobat, diampuni oleh Allah. Begitu. Makanya KH Quraish Shihab saat menilai Syi’ah itu sesat atau lurus, beliau juga melihat perkembangan mereka. Yang tobat dan mengharamkan penghinaan thd sahabat ya otomatis tidak sesat. Sebaliknya yang tetap menghina, ini sesat.\n\nPenghinaan pun macam-macam tingkatnya. Dari sekedar kritik yang santun, hingga penghinaan yang amat amat keji. Kitabnya pun ada. Sahabat yang dihina pun macam-macam. Dari sahabat Abu Bakar ra dan Umar bin Khoththob yang namanya dijamin Nabi masuk surga, hingga Mu’awiyah yang masuk Islam setelah Futuh Mekkah da anaknya Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, Sayyidina Husein ra.\n\nMenghina Siti Aisyah ra, Abu Bakar ra, dan Umar bin Khoththob ra tidak dibenarkan apa pun alasannya. Sesat. Sebaliknya menyatakan bahwa Mu’awiyah berontak terhadap Khalifah Ali atau Yazid yang anak buahnya memenggal cucu Nabi, itu sekedar kritik berdasarkan fakta sejarah. Namun kaum Sunni tetap menjaga lisan mereka untuk tidak mengutuk atau menghina Mu’awiyah dan Yazid. Urusan mereka ada di tangan Allah.",

Our thoughts and prayers are with our fallen team member, his family and our extended team,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"We are working with law enforcement to investigate the circumstances of the incident,\" it added.\n\nThe Carr Fire has scorched 154,524 acres (62,534 hectares) of land since July 23, when authorities say it was triggered by the \"mechanical failure of a vehicle\" that caused sparks to fly in tinderbox-dry conditions.\n\nThe fire has also razed more than 1,600 buildings, including some 1,000 homes, making it the sixth most destructive blaze in the history of the fire-prone western state, state officials say.\n\nMore than 4,200 firefighters have been deployed to battle the conflagration but they have only succeeded in containing 41 percent of it so far.\n\nOther fires raging in the state include the Mendocino Complex, comprised of two blazes: the River Fire and the Ranch Fire.\n\nSeveral thousand people have been evacuated as the fires swept across the state, although some have been given permission in recent days to return to their homes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump blamed the fires' destruction on \"bad environmental laws,\" but did not mention evacuees or victims of the inferno.\n\n\"California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!\"\n\nThe US president drew international outrage last year after withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate change pact that is aimed at combatting global warming.",

        "articleBody": "DEAR ABBY: My husband of more than 20 years just purchased plane tickets to India. It’s a 24-hour trip from the USA. My problem is, he is sitting in business class, while I’m in economy. We have plenty of money, but he simply doesn’t want to spend it. He’s older and has health concerns and mobility issues.\n\nAm I right to feel hurt and consider his love of money may be stronger than his love for me? Or should I be content and happy I’m going to a beautiful country? -- FEELING LIKE SECOND RATE\n\nDEAR FEELING: Of course you should be happy that you will be visiting a beautiful country. Content, not so much. You have a right to be upset at your penny-pinching husband for providing less-comfortable accommodations for you than he has arranged for himself on that long flight. Upgrade your seat! You have a right to put your foot down and make clear that the two of you either sit together or he’ll be sitting first-class in the doghouse.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband and I were getting ready to leave after dinner at a restaurant we’ve patronized for 15 years. I went to the ladies’ room and was washing my hands when a waitress I don’t care for came barging in, got in my face and started yelling at me. I tried to leave, but she wouldn’t let me out of the restroom. I asked her several times to let me out, and she kept telling me no. When she finally let me go, I told the man in charge what she did.\n\nMy husband called him later, but the manager believed the waitress, who said that I started it. Another waitress who calls me her “sister” didn’t answer the texts I sent her. I am very hurt that she ignored me. Clearly, she believes the waitress, too.\n\nThe restroom encounter left red marks all over my arm, but the manager didn’t care. The offender has left town and moved out of state. I’m 74 and was tempted to go to the police but didn’t. Now I wish I had pressed charges. Should I have? -- BEATEN UP IN CALIFORNIA\n\nDEAR BEATEN UP: There is probably more to this story than what you have written, but yes, you should have notified the police. You were assaulted and falsely imprisoned in that restroom. Had you contacted the police and gone to an emergency room about the marks on your arm, you would have had proof about what the woman did to you.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My older sister has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine might have protected her from it, had it been available to our generation.\n\nA few of us were out to lunch recently, and when I asked a younger sister if her granddaughter had received the vaccine, she went off on me like I had asked something terrible. Do you think I was wrong for asking? I have grandkids and would not be offended if someone asked me that question. -- CONCERNED SISTER\n\nDEAR CONCERNED SISTER: If you and the younger sister are close, then I don’t think your question was offensive. However, if you are not, because it was asked in front of friends, she may have interpreted it as an implication that her granddaughter -- who is, of course, pure as the driven snow -- is sexually active, which made her defensive.\n\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Réouverture des terrasses et salles des restaurants, bars et cafés, jauges dans les commerces, musées ou dans les cinémas... Franceinfo fait le point sur les précisions de Matignon.\n• Pour les restaurants, cafés et bars. Les terrasses de ces établissements vont rouvrir à 50% de leur capacité d'accueil le 19 mai, avec des tables comptant six personnes maximum. Ces dernières devront rester assises.\n• Pour les commerces. L'ensemble des magasins considérés comme non essentiels en période de confinement vont pouvoir à leur tour rouvrir le 19 mai. Un client à la fois sera autorisé dans les enseignes de moins de 8 m2, et un minimum de 8 m2 par client sera requis pour les magasins de superficie plus importante. La règle sera la même pour les marchés ouverts, et sera de 4 m2 par personne pour les marchés en extérieur.\n• Pour les musées. Une jauge de 8 m2 par personne est également prévue pour la réouverture des musées le 19 mai.\n• Pour les cinémas et salles de spectacle. Ces salles vont de nouveau accueillir du public le 19 mai, avec une capacité maximale d'accueil de 35% et un plafond de 800 spectateurs, précise Matignon auprès du Parisien. Cette règle s'appliquera également aux salles des fêtes et salles polyvalentes.\n• Pour les cérémonies religieuses et les mariages civils. Ces cérémonies pourront avoir lieu avec seulement un siège sur trois occupé, et un fonctionnement en quinconce d'une rangée à l'autre.\n• Pour les salles de sport et les piscines. Ces établissements pourront rouvrir dès le 19 mai pour \"les pratiquants prioritaires\" comme les mineurs, détaille Le Parisien. La jauge sera de 35% pour le public, et un plafond de 800 spectateurs sera établi.\n• Pour les restaurants, cafés et bars. Pour la deuxième étape de ces réouvertures, le 9 juin, les terrasses pourront cette fois-ci rouvrir entièrement, avec toutefois le maintien de tables de six personnes maximum. Les salles de ces établissements pourront également rouvrir, avec une capacité d'accueil de 50% et des tablées de six maximum également.\n• Pour les commerces.

Un pass sanitaire sera demandé pour tout accueil de plus de 1 000 spectateurs.\n• Pour les restaurants, cafés et bars. Les salles de ces établissements pourront ouvrir entièrement, tout en assurant le maintien des gestes barrières et de la distanciation physique. Un protocole sanitaire sera appliqué selon la situation épidémique à cette date.\n• Pour les commerces. Le 30 juin doit marquer, en principe, la fin des jauges dans les magasins et marchés, précise Matignon.\n• Pour les musées. Des jauges ne seront plus nécessaires dans les musées, mais le gouvernement appelle toutefois au maintien des mesures de distanciation physique, et au respect des gestes barrières dans ces établissements.\n• Pour les cinémas et salles de spectacle. Ces lieux pourront accueillir du public sans jauge à partir du 30 juin, toujours dans le respect de la distanciation physique et des gestes barrières. Un pass sanitaire restera appliqué pour tout événement rassemblant plus de 1 000 personnes.\n• Pour les cérémonies religieuses et les mariages civils. L'ensemble des sièges pourront être occupés dès le 30 juin.\n• Pour les salles de sport et les piscines. Tous les sports seront permis dans ces établissements, et la capacité d'accueil du public passera à 100% le 30 juin. Un pass sanitaire sera toujours appliqué.\n• Pour les concerts debout et les festivals. A partir du 30 juin, les concerts debout vont pouvoir reprendre, avec un plafond de participants que le préfet fixera. Le pass sanitaire sera requis pour tout concert rassemblant plus de 1 000 spectateurs.

        "articleBody": "Two hostages — an American and an Australian — who had been held by the Taliban in Afghanistan since 2016 were released Tuesday in a prisoner swap for three high-ranking insurgents.\n\nAmerican Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks, both professors at the American University of Kabul, were handed over to US ­forces in the country’s southern Zabul province, an insurgent source told Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe men were flown out of the region on US choppers, according to a local police source. Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed three Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar.\n\nBoth sides said they were hopeful the swap could lead to a breakthrough in stalled efforts to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with the Kabul government and begin work toward a political settlement to end the group’s 18-year insurgency. Peace would allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops.\n\nThe released insurgents included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban’s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the Afghan guerrilla insurgent group’s Haqqani network.\n\nThe Taliban members were released in Doha, Qatar, where the group maintains a political office, according to a Taliban representative.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release of the hostages “give[s] us hope for the success of intra-Afghan peace negotiations, which the United States stands ready to support.\n\n“We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement.”\n\nThe US welcomed the exchange, saying the hostages had suffered from their ordeal. “We pray for the full recovery of both men,” said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. “We thank the Afghan government for its actions, in the spirit of our partnership that enabled the freeing of the hostages.”\n\nWhen Afghan President Ashraf Ghani first announced the potential exchange last week, he said Kabul had ensured that the freed militants would not return to the front line.\n\nHe also said he hoped the swap would “pave the way” for unofficial direct talks between his government and the Taliban, who have long refused to negotiate peace with Kabul.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, “We are profoundly pleased and relieved” at the hostages’ release, adding that Weeks’ family had asked to convey its own relief and gratitude.\n\nKing and Weeks were abducted by gunmen wearing military uniforms in the heart of Afghan capital in August 2016. The next year, the Taliban released two videos of them and another in January 2017 in which the hostages appeared pale and gaunt.\n\nBoth men claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their governments to help in their release — but it’s impossible to know whether they were forced to speak.\n\nUS officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the hostages at one point that failed to find the hostages.\n\nWashington and the Taliban had been holding direct talks pursuing an agreement for US troops to begin leaving Afghanistan. They were on the verge of a deal when President Trump scuttled the talks in September, citing Taliban violence.",

        "articleBody": "We're just going to come out and say it: Women can run, lift, plank, and climb as well as (if not better than) any sweaty dude sporting a cut-off T-shirt at the gym. Sometimes, guys just need a little reminder that being a woman isn’t synonymous for being a weakling. Check out how seven women reduced big, bad men to little boys—and just try not to spit your protein shake all over the floor.\n\n“I’m 5 feet tall and weigh maybe 105 or 115 pounds. I wouldn't know exactly since I never get on a scale. But aesthetically, I don't look like a bodybuilder and my petite size is misleading. So one day, when the squat rack was free, I proceeded to start my warmup. As I was getting ready to start, this guy, maybe 6’7” tall, comes and asks how many I have left. I politely let him know I was just starting but that he could feel free to jump in. I let him go first. As he racked the plates, I warmed up doing burpees. When he finished, he started to take off a plate. I politely said, ‘No don't remove that.’ He looked at me, puzzled, and asked, ‘Are you doing the same weight?’ I smiled and said, ‘No, I want to add another plate.’ I started to do my set. Before I even finished, he had left.” —Malvina P.\n\n“I was doing a fitness challenge at my gym about five years ago and was paired against another guy. Each of us were supposed to hold a plank, which I love to challenge myself in, for as long as we could. Going into it, the guy was told that my previous plank personal record was seven minutes and 30 seconds. So guess what? He holds his plank for 7 minutes and 35 seconds. Then, I held mine for eight minutes and 20 seconds.” —Kimberly M.\n\n“Shortly after we started dating, I asked my boyfriend to lift with me at my gym. According to him, he lifted every day, so I didn’t think joining me would be all that challenging. Little did he know, though, that he was walking into my territory, where chicks lift heavy and push just as hard as any guy. He ended up making it through about 20 minutes of my workout before he disappeared to the restroom for the next 20 minutes. He returned pale but ready to give it another go. Later that morning, he had to drive about an hour to work and actually had to walk backward up the stairs so his legs wouldn’t crumble under him. Today, we're married, and he survives the gym daily with me—but he still takes breaks in the bathroom while I secretly smile and continue my sets.” —Jess K.\n\n“While I was training for my first half-marathon, the weather forced me inside for more than a few long runs. About halfway through one, a guy hopped on the treadmill next to me. As I saw him peeking at my screen, he quickly adjusted his speed to exactly match mine. 'So annoying,' I thought. But I wasn’t going to screw up my pacing by trying to beat him at his own racing game. It turns out, I didn’t need to. About a mile into his run, he slowed it down to a walk, huffing and puffing like he had been doing an all-out sprint. I ran four more miles after that.\" —Christine R.\n\n“I don't max lift often, but one day when I was max lifting on the leg press, I started with one plate on each side. The guy on the leg press next to me had three on each. I caught him glancing at my weight and giggling. His giggling subsided when he stopped at six plates on each side and I kept on going. I continued to add a plate to each side until I had 20 plates total. No, I can't do this every day and only did three reps with that weight—but I will admit that it felt good to shut that one dude up. Who knows, maybe he helped me PR that day.” —Angela H.\n\n“My husband and I used to do workout routines from health and fitness magazines together. I would pull out my sets of weights and tell him to get heavier ones. But he usually ended up grabbing lighter ones like mine, resting more, and complaining. He wasn't a fan of my tips on his technique and form, either. We've done more separate workouts lately. Ha! ” —Jennifer N.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

        "articleBody": "In July 2018, we recommended a $5.1 million grant to Evidence Action Beta to create a program dedicated to developing potential GiveWell top charities by prototyping, testing, and scaling programs which have the potential to be highly impactful and cost-effective.\n\nThis grant was made as part of GiveWell’s Incubation Grants program, which aims to support potential future GiveWell top charities and to help grow the pipeline of organizations we can consider for a recommendation. Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we work closely.\n\nThis post will discuss the following:\n• Why Evidence Action Beta is promising. (More)\n• Risks we see with this Incubation Grant. (More)\n• Our plans for following Evidence Action Beta’s work going forward. (More)\n\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\n\nA key part of GiveWell’s research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs. GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create … [an] incubator … focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them. We have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, … our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities. We believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling … promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\n\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\n\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta’s parent organization, Evidence Action, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water).\n\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant’s cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could.\n• if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\n• if Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities—in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities’ funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities’ funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\n\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn’t direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly.\n\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta’s incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here.)\n\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research.\n\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\n\nRisks to the success of the grant\n\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\n• Few programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell’s 2017 top charities, or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\n• We expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities, end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\n\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely.\n\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.",

        "articleBody": "Hanwha Q Cells was reportedly South Korea’s largest cell maker at the end of 2017, with 3.7 GW of annual production capacity.\n\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) has unveiled a plan to help the PV industry further reduce the costs of solar module technology and to increase product efficiency.\n\nThe initiative is part of the Fourth Energy Technology Development Plan and Roadmap, submitted to Korean renewable energy industry representatives this week. The plan includes actions to raise electromobility rates, reduce coal-fired fine dusts by 90%, improve nuclear safety and increase the scale of wind power projects, among other measures.\n\nSixteen energy technology priorities identified by MOTIE in the roadmap include a reduction in solar module costs from around $0.23/W today to $0.10 by 2030, helped by unspecified research and development investment. As a way of rough comparison, the SunShot Initiative launched by the U.S. government in 2011 aims to reduce the price of the solar electricity generated by large scale projects to $0.03/kWh by 2030. In September 2017, the Department of Energy announced the $0.06/kWh benchmark of that ambition had been achieved three years early.\n\nThe South Korean government also wants to help manufacturers increase solar module efficiency from around 20% now to 24% by the end of the next decade. Seoul expects PV cell producers to increase the average efficiency of multi-junction devices from 23% to 35%.\n\nNo details were provided on how the industrial and technological targets would be achieved.\n\nThe plan appears consistent with another announced by MOTIE in March, which aimed to introduce carbon footprint certification rules, minimum efficiency levels and industrial standards for solar and wind power. Those planned guidelines are yet to see the light of day.\n\nA recent report by the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Program stated the South Korean solar module industry had an annual production capacity of around 8.69 GW at the end of 2017. Hanwha Q Cells had 3.7 GW of cell capacity and the same volume of module operations at that point and LG Electronics had 3 GW of output, also evenly split between cells and modules. A further 17 manufacturers, according to the report, had production operations ranging from 30-600 MW.\n\nHowever, the reduction in demand seen after Beijing attempted to rein in public solar subsidies at the end of May last year ensures some of that 8.69 GW of Korean production lines may have since been idled or closed altogether.\n\nSouth Korea also hosts several polysilicon manufacturers, including the OCI Group and Hanwha Q Cells parent Hanwha Group. That industry too is suffering from oversupply and anti-dumping duties on polysilicon imports by the Chinese government since July 2013.\n\nDespite the manufacturing setbacks introduced by its regional neighbor and solar giant, South Korea is seeing stronger than ever solar project deployment. According to data released by MOTIE in August, newly installed capacity for the first seven months of the year reached 1.64 GW and Seoul plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. That ambitious target is expected to be achieved with giant solar parks such as a recently announced 2.1 GW floating solar project and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array planned in the Saemangeum area and announced by president Moon Jae-in a year ago.",

        "articleBody": "Breaking with decades of United States policy favoring free trade, President Donald Trump has pursued an agenda favoring tariffs as weapons in a widening trade war.\n\n\"We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great betrayal is over,\" Trump said at a rally in Monroe, La., on Nov. 6, 2019. \"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\"\n\nBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly.\n\nTariffs have also strengthened the United States’ leverage after massive job losses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of Trump’s tariff decisions.\n\nMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary victims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while tariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy.\n\n\"As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\" said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. \"Tariffs, like any tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the trading relationship poorer — not richer.\"\n\nStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger fraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do.\n\nThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the United States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the world.\n\nWho pays the cost of a tariff?\n\nWhen the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn’t foreign exporters that make the payment. The importers do, and they’re usually U.S. companies.\n\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer — say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written. \"The Chinese government pays nothing.\"\n\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don’t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill.\n\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are high enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It’s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality.\n\nRevenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through June 30, 2019.\n\nThat’s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs. For context, that’s less than 2% of annual federal revenues.\n\nMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two years.\n\nHow big an impact have the Trump tariffs had overall?\n\nAs we’ve noted, a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods, \"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\n\nSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era tariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by 2020. If that holds up, that would work out to a $75.3 billion dollar hit on economic growth, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who studies U.S.-Canada trade.\n\nOther estimates are in the same ballpark. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump administration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while lowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent jobs.\n\nWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too. Facing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer Chinese goods, thereby hurting China’s gross domestic product.\n\nWhat tariffs has the United States imposed?\n\nIt started with washing machines and solar panels in February 2018, followed by steel and aluminum in March 2018.\n\nChina-specific tariffs took effect in July 2018, primarily covering machinery, followed by additional tariffs on China in August 2018 that covered plastics, more machinery, and electrical equipment.\n\nThe first big expansion into consumer goods from China came in September 2018, affecting home goods, electronics, furniture, backpacks, and other goods. Tariffs on Chinese goods were increased from 10% to 25% in May 2019, and the list of impacted goods expanded in September 2019 to cover some clothes, shoes, televisions and Bluetooth devices.\n\nTariffs have also been imposed on imports from the European Union, including many food products.\n\n\"The overall impact is now over $4 billion per month in extra tariffs on a wide range of goods,\" said Daniel Anthony, vice president of the Trade Partnership, a trade-focused consulting firm in Washington.\n\nWhat are the major products or sectors that have suffered negative impacts from tariffs?\n\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers.\n\nU.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. (Bad weather and other factors may have had an impact as well.)\n\nIn the meantime, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs.\n\nComputers and electronic devices have seen impacts, too, said Mary E. Lovely, a Syracuse University economist. \"About 36% of imports from China to the U.S. are computers and electronic devices,\" she said.\n\nAnd U.S. imports of \"intermediate goods\" from China, such as motors, pumps, and semiconductors, have seen price increases, harming U.S. producers. \"When the price of these inputs go up, U.S. businesses find it harder to compete against non-U.S. competitors, even in the U.S. market,\" Lovely said.",

        "articleBody": "A soothing pillow and warm duvet might not always lead to better rest. A 43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling extreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet lung,\" according to a new case report.\n\nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained malaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.\n\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\n\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed CT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\n\nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather bedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a compound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was diagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\n\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\n\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\n\n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study.\n\nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\"\n\nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\n\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.\n\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal .",

        "articleBody": "The core stage of the first SLS at Michoud Assembly Facility after the installation in early November of its four RS-25 engines. (credit: NASA/Jude Guidry) \n\n Earlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of its long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four RS-25 engines into the rocket’s core stage. With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a “Green Run” test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch. “If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,” Cooke said. The SLS has been a key part of NASA’s exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX. Recently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isn’t using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches. That criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration’s own party in Congress. “Every space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,” said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee’s space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA’s exploration plans. He raised that point in criticism of NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.) “While I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,” he continued. He and others at the hearing questioned NASA’s approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA’s current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit. That is, for some, way too many launches. “The fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,” said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee. (Cooke’s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS core stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views long before working with Boeing.) “If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” Stafford said of returning to the Moon. “SLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry Orion,” he continued. “If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date.” He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two SLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the two rendezvousing in lunar orbit—no Gateway required. At last week’s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom Stafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them about the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission safety. “The mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,” Stafford, a member of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke’s earlier testimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success with the current multiple-launch approach. “I cannot disagree with it.” “But with eight launches, I’ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of success goes down to about 50 percent,” he concluded. Stafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-lift launch vehicle. “If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” he said. “You have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big, wide-diameter booster. If you don’t have it, you’re not going to make it.” Young, in his testimony, didn’t specifically address the use of SLS versus commercial rockets, but did criticize what he called “experiments” in procurement. “Managing and contracting experiments must be excluded from the Mars-Moon program,” he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment, he brought up the HLS program. “A management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to the surface of the Moon,” he said. “I personally think that these should be government-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.” He also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human spaceflight. “The plate is really full today,” he said. “I personally think that the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number two is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done that will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.” One thing Young would push off NASA’s plate is the Gateway. “I do not really see a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,” he said, although it could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. “There’s not a compelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.” Bridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.” Last week’s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of Congress questioned NASA’s use—or unwillingness to use—the SLS. At a hearing last month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater use of SLS. “I understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for SLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,” he said, including the first Block 1B. “What do you think?” “It depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,” responded NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn’t funding to support that increased production rate, even if it is possible. “We haven’t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we’re guaranteed the second core we’d need for a Moon landing in 2024,” added Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA and the other witness at the hearing. At current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced by 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first crewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024 that would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface of the Moon. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.” Aderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. “What commercial launch vehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to launch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the Moon by 2024?” Bridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But for the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy and Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman’s OmegA. “There could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,” Bridenstine added. “We’re not shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some investment from Boeing to achieve.” “What is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not available by 2024,” Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy is, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles—or SLS. “But if commercial’s not available, what’s the contingency plan?” Aderholt asked again. “I think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing in 2024 very, very difficult,” Bridenstine said. “If we don’t have the additional rockets, then we’re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu we’re confident we’ll have those rockets.” “If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” Babin said of potential spending shortfalls for Artemis. Aderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets, citing Cooke’s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged that more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall architecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more launches was riskier than one with fewer launches. “We’re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing System how their systems ought to be developed,” Bridenstine said. “We’re waiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we’ll assess their approaches.” Boeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that its approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day the proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would involve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B. “Using the lift capability of NASA’s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have developed a ‘Fewest Steps to the Moon’ approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,” Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said in that statement. The only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the “national team” led by Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin’s New Glenn vehicles would be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely believed to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that.) NASA’s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House nor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion budget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis on track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. José Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose. “It’s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don’t know the costs down the road,” Serrano said. He suggested pushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to this March, “in order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.” Babin referred to those comments at last week’s hearing, concluding that the odds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were ”dwindling.” “If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” he said. “This could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments already made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.” Others, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA’s architecture for returning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also include revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.

Why it’s crucial, actually!\n\nI’ll share a free tool that will help you put your business in focus and pinpoint what to work on right now — in less than five minutes.\n\nIf we haven’t met yet, my name is Pamela Wilson — and I have been working online since 2010.\n\nI’m a three-time author, a keynote speaker, and an online educator, coach, and mastermind group leader.\n\nIn this article I’m sharing my approach to online business growth.\n\nIt was born from helping thousands of people create the online presence they’ve dreamt of — and seeing way too many of them lose focus and struggle to get any results at all.\n\nOnce you understand my simple approach, you’ll feel much better about where you are in the online business growth process — and that’s a promise.\n\nHow can I promise you’re about to feel better?\n\nBecause once you understand my approach …\n• You’ll recognize you don’t have to master everything about online business all at once\n• Your to-do list will shrink to 25% of its current size\n• You’ll be able to safely ignore 75% of the online information you’re seeing right now\n\nGet ready to start enjoying the process of building your online business — maybe for the first time ever!\n\nIf you are …\n• Trying to build an online business because you have deep expertise on a specific topic — but you’re “on hold” because you’re feeling overwhelmed\n• Wanting to leave a legacy of information and guidance around a topic you’re passionate about — but you don’t know where to start\n• Passionate about the business idea you’ve imagined — but unsure about how to make it happen\n\n… stick around.

Not paying attention to this will virtually guarantee that you will stay stuck where you are.\n\nAnd you’ll have a lot less money in your bank account.\n\nWhen you step into the online space, you’ll meet a whole new cast of characters. And they will try to sell you some pretty compelling stories.\n\nIt takes time to build a successful business — offline and online.\n\nI want you to embrace this reality — because I’m about to show you how to get time on your side.\n\nTrying to build an online business isn’t as simple as lots of people would have you believe. It has its challenges.\n\nThere’s a lot of technology to master. There’s marketing involved — a lot of marketing. Maybe more marketing than you’re comfortable with.\n\nAnd there are all these moving parts — disparate bits of software that needs to interact to present your business and your offers seamlessly.\n\nYou’re about to save some major frustration, my friend. Money, too! Because it turns out your don’t need to Buy All The Things and Learn All The Things in order to make it online.\n\nI developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and error — mine, and the people I taught.\n\nFocus on what really matters in the near future of your business\n\nPlan & Grow BIG helps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might be stopping you from making real progress in your online business.\n\nMaybe you’re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you’ve been trying for years to build a business idea you’ve had in your head — but it just isn’t living up to what you expected.\n\nI developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting sidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they “needed” to master.\n\nFor example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads — before they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were going to offer.\n\nAnd I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was proven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an unproven product.)\n\nI saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. 🙁\n\nSmart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But they were completely baffled by this “online business thing.”\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the frustrations myself.\n\nTrue confession: I had to learn business focus the hard way\n\nBefore I outline the Plan & Grow BIG approach and the specifics for each stage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out.\n\nI’m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this.\n\nBack in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business, Zurek Design.\n\nI had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled projects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also juggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their “launch” phases — they were in high school and starting to look at universities and think about their careers.\n\nI didn’t have a lot of time to spare.\n\nPlus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become much more of a “public figure” than I had ever had to be in my business in the past. I’d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And I’d need to “put myself out there” on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars, and in online video.\n\nAnd although my offline business was making a solid income, my online business idea — to share my marketing and design training with others — wasn’t making a single cent.\n\nIt turns out that I was more courageous than I knew.\n\nBecause I did — I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course called Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time — an enormous amount of money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point.\n\nI truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that investment, I was telling myself, “This dream matters. This dream is going to become a reality. I’m taking this seriously.”\n\nOnce I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new, things started happening for me.\n\nWithin a few months, I (the person who didn’t want to be seen online) had an article accepted by the company behind the course I took — on one of the most-popular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger.\n\nThen another article went live. And another.\n\nNot just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the day.\n\nAnd through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then coaching.\n\nOut with the old, in with the new (and better)\n\nWithin a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline business made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to focus exclusively on my online efforts.\n\nThat’s what happens when you put your business in focus — and you spend time doing what really matters.\n\nNow, I’m considered an authority on building an online presence.\n\nThat company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach their audience for a couple of years.\n\nHere’s what’s different in my life now:\n• My business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas)\n• I am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from me\n• My books are well-received and much loved — and deliver income to me every single month\n• People find my website and join my community every day, all year long\n• I’m able to travel anywhere I’d like because my business fits in my backpack\n• I can “dial up” or “dial back” my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my schedule\n\nI also have complete control over the direction I take my business. I answer to no one but myself! And I can adapt my offerings to what my audience needs whenever I’d like.\n\nBut this story isn’t about me.\n\nWhat I’m about to share is the exact plan I’ve developed after seeing what truly works online.\n\nIt’s the approach that has allowed me to build the business I have today. A business where I’m in control — of my time, my projects, my earnings.\n\nAnd that’s what I want for you.\n\nYou wouldn’t have read this far if you didn’t also want to build this kind of online business!\n\nThat’s why I want to make it easier for you.\n\nWhat is your business focus right now?\n\nIf you can’t answer that question immediately, read on.\n\nHow to use Plan & Grow BIG to put your business in focus and get your mindset straight\n\nThe purpose of the Plan & Grow BIG approach is to help you develop business focus — and eliminate the feeling of overwhelm that keeps you from making progress.\n\nI want to show you how you can ignore most of the information you see!\n\nAnd how developing business focus will allow you to build the business you’re dreaming about much faster — and with less frustration.\n\nTo get started, I created a simple quiz that will help you get more value from this article.\n\nClick the button above so you can:\n• Discover what business-building stage you’re in now\n• Assess what you’re starting with — make a list of your current assets\n• Pinpoint what your current business focus should be\n• Get to know what happens in the other business stages — so you can put your business in focus\n\nAs we go through each stage of the Plan & Grow BIG approach, I want you to identify areas of opportunity for your current situation.\n\nThe four simple stages of Plan & Grow BIG\n\nThe Plan Stage: Think and dream productively\n\nIt’s the early days of your business.\n\nThink BIG. And work only on what’s needed in this stage.\n\nIn the PLAN stage, make these your business focus:\n• Pinpoint your ideal customer: Who will your online business serve? Warning: many people try to skip this step — don’t! You need to become acquainted with the people you want to reach and help before you build your branding and offers.\n• Get your branding in place: The earlier the better when it comes to\n\nbuilding your brand. You’ll want to decide your business name and\n\ntagline, select your brand colors, and choose your brand fonts.\n• Map out your first offer: Decide how what solutions you’ll deliver and how you’ll deliver them. Will they be products, services, or both?\n\nThat’s it. Once you’ve completed the items above, it’s time to start building your business, my friend. Ready?\n\nTime to make ideas real. As you build these tangible business assets, remember: you don’t have to do it all at once.\n\nFocus on these business goals during the BUILD stage:\n• Build your initial website: You’ll need a Homepage, an About page, a Contact page, and some kind of “commerce” page, like a Store or Services page. Attract prospects by publishing regular content like blog articles, podcast episodes, or a video series.\n• Build your first offer: Don’t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that’s relatively simple — but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that.\n• Build an initial funnel: Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers.\n\nAnd now … stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it’s tempting to look around at Version 9.0 of your competitors’ sites and feel like you have to catch up to them.\n\nNonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and be proud you’re ready to move on …\n\nThe Implement Stage: Iterate to find what works\n\nOooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can feel deeply uncomfortable.\n\nBut growth usually does feel uncomfortable, doesn’t it?\n\nThe IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that’s perfectly fine. Here’s what you’ll focus on while you’re there:\n• Make your offers live: Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great — but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs.\n• Focus on building your email list. Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list — think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a referral network.\n• Discover what works for launching your products and services. Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience.\n\nRemember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to develop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business. Patience, my friend!\n\nBut once you’ve hit on a winning product or service, you’ll be ready for …\n\nIn the GROW stage, you’ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably in your business — and now you’ll focus on leveraging that success.\n• Improve your conversion rates: Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what’s working. You’ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible.\n• Add more revenue streams: As you dial into what’s working well, you may uncover your customers’ unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You’ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream.\n\nThe GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are reliable and you’re able to make some serious investments in your business.\n\nReady? Set? Get your business in focus!\n\nNow that you know your business stage (you DID take the quiz, right?), you can tap into the power of focused attention and make fast progress. Ignore all the techniques you’ll need in future stages, and just aim to master the stage you’re in.\n\nGet the Online Business Success Roadmap for an overview and a handy checklist of all the Plan & Grow BIG stages.\n\nWhen you do this, you can count on steady business growth — with less frustration and more confidence because you’re focused on the right thing at the right time.\n\nThe next BIG challenge is …\n\nNow that you’re clear about how to use a focused approach to eliminate frustration and make faster progress, here’s the next big online business challenge …\n\nBecoming a “visible” and public leader in your space.\n\nThis was a HUGE stumbling block for me.\n\nIn the next article, I’m going to share my mindset tips and tricks to help you become more comfortable with becoming a visible online leader. Once you embrace the increased visibility that comes with building an online business, you’ll see all sorts of interesting doors open up.\n\nThe BIG question is, how do you successfully shape an online business dream into a viable online business that gives you the income, freedom, and recognition you deserve?\n\nIt comes down to business focus. Which is easy once you know what to focus on, and what to ignore.\n\nOnce you’ve built that business, you have to stand out in front of it and represent it in your marketing, on social media, and at in-person events.\n\nIf you don’t master this, you’ll severely limit your reach and your impact. So how do you get comfortable with this increased visibility?\n\nHow can you step up and embrace the “internet limelight?” Because once you do, online doors will open for you!\n\nRead about that topic in the next article in this series, How to Adopt an Online Leader Success Mindset.",

        "articleBody": "WASHINGTON – Two federal prison officers were charged Tuesday with falsifying records, stating they had checked on accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in the hours before he hanged himself in his Manhattan cell.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, assigned to Epstein's special housing unit at Metropolitan Correctional Center, \"browsed the Internet,\" lingered in an office common area and appeared to sleep for two hours when they should have been conducting inmate checks.\n\nNoel and Thomas signed \"false certifications\" attesting they had made their required rounds, according to court records.\n\nProsecutors alleged that no inmate checks were made from 10:30 p.m. Aug. 9 to 6:30 a.m. the following morning, when the officers discovered Epstein's body. During that time, the officers should have conducted five separate inmate counts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly showed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night, according to court documents.\n\n“As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,” Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news release. “Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.”\n\nEach defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records. Noel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is charged with three.\n\nThe conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the charges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nNoel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday afternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond within a week.\n\nEpstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many victims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related conspiracy charges.\n\nHis suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered multiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations at the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\n\nIndictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress\n\nAs the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage over the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the prison system.\n\n\"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer, repeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track of such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify against his other co-conspirators.\"\n\nProsecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from at least 2002 to 2005.\n\nSasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\n\"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they’re not the end of this.\n\n\"These guards aren’t the only ones who should stand trial – every one of Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars,” Sasse said.\n\nHawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation and a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she acknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other instances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and falsified records to show that they had.\n\n\"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This incident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when something bad happens.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems within the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\"\n\nAlthough representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier may have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports anything other than suicide.\n\nInvestigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\n\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself with a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered.\n\nFor months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned to Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\n\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks.\n\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do any rounds.\"\n\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters’ questions.\n\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. “It is our hope that we’ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,” said Jason Foy, who represents Noel.\n\nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would “ruin his life.”\n\n“We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,” Figgins said.\n\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they’re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they’re going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?”\n\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died. “When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you’ll have a different appreciation for what was going on.”\n\nPrison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised security at the Manhattan facility.\n\nStaffers 'don't care':Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union. Prison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said.\n\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, the one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.\n\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\n\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system.\n\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center.\n\nAfter the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public’s trust in us.”\n\nEpstein's inner circle eyed: Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could still go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\n\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell, semiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring days later, which has drawn investigative interest.\n\nExperts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\n“When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego.\n\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt.\n\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\n\n“Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.”",

        "articleBody": "Instagram began testing hiding public like counts globally on Thursday, after experimenting with the design tweak in several individual markets abroad. People who upload photos and videos will still know how many people liked them—that information just won’t be seen by other users. The experiment is part of a wider shift at social media companies, so far mostly a rhetorical one, away from the metrics it once told people had immense value. Like Instagram head Adam Mosseri, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has spoken out about the toxic consequences of overemphasizing statistics like follower and like counts. Twitter also released a beta version of its app earlier this year that puts less prominence on likes and retweets.\n\nBut Instagram is one of the only major platforms to try bringing so-called demetrication to a wider segment of users. It’s previously tested removing likes in Italy, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Amid growing criticism of online platforms, abandoning likes allowed Mosseri to claim that Instagram wants to be “a space that feels much less pressurized.” But the Facebook-owned company has also quietly encouraged some users to embrace the anxiety and power that enhanced metrics can provide, by prompting them to convert their personal profiles into Instagram business accounts. Unsurprisingly, opening a business account is also a gateway to buying ads.\n\nInstagram first introduced business accounts in 2016. There are now 140 million monthly active “businesses” across Facebook’s various platforms, according to the company. Any user can convert their personal profile into a “business” or “creator” one at any time, both of which come with souped-up analytics capabilities. Many normal people, with no intention of making money from their Instagram presence, have opted-in to the feature. In the age of influencers, where the line between personal branding and personal life has all but disappeared, some people are naturally eager to run their Instagram profile like it’s a job—and Instagram is happy to help.\n\nKym Lino, a spokesperson for Instagram, confirmed to WIRED that the company notifies people who it thinks could benefit from converting their personal accounts into business ones. “We use a machine learning model which predicts likely commercial intent of Instagram accounts to identify potential accounts that may benefit from professional tools like analytics,” they said in an email. It’s unclear what those signals might be, and Instagram declined to say.\n\nI changed my personal Instagram profile, which I started in 2013, into a professional one several weeks ago. Instagram allows you to choose what type of business you run, and I earnestly chose “Journalist.” I later found that many people, especially teens, opt for more ironic options like Cruise Line or Well Water Drilling Service. One friend has labeled herself a Grocery Store. After a few days, the statistics started rolling in. I could suddenly see things like how many people unfollowed me each week, how many visited my profile, and how many tapped on the people and places I tagged in my stories. It was eye-opening.\n\nI learned that over a dozen people tapped on the profile of a coworker after I tagged us eating Mexican food in my story. And I found out 46 people, for some reason or another, visited my profile in the last week—but only 16 had come from the one picture I uploaded. On that photo, of one of my oldest friends, I had written a long and gushing caption celebrating her birthday. My business account informed me that someone sent it to another person via direct message, but I couldn’t tell who or why. The analytics made salient the ways my friends and acquaintances surveil one another on Instagram all the time.",

        "articleBody": "I don't remember which game we were playing, but it was the kind of Japanese RPG that listed everything you needed to know about its characters down the side of the screen. Magic points, coins, food, all summed up with helpful numbers. Only one of them was abbreviated: HP.\n\n“What does HP stand for in this game?” I asked my friend, an expert on JRPGs.\n\n“Health pineapples,” he confidently replied. “You have to knock all the pineapples off before you can hurt someone.”\n\nHP, whether it stands for hit points, health power, or indeed health pineapples, is one of many mechanics to come to video games via the original tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. However, the idea of representing the amount of punishment a character can take with a discrete number of points is much older than D&D. And while we might all know what the abbreviation means, it turns out that what hit points are meant to represent isn't quite so obvious.\n\nIn , D&D's co-creator Dave Arneson explained that the earliest version of the game didn't have hit points. The rules had evolved from wargames he and fellow D&D inventor Gary Gygax played, in which a single successful attack was all it took for a soldier to die.\n\nThat changed when they started experimenting with having players control individual heroes rather than entire armies, as players identified with them much more strongly. As Arneson put it, “They didn't care if they could kill a monster in one blow, but they didn't want the monster to kill them in one blow.”\n\nArneson had previously made his own rules for a naval wargame set during the Civil War called Ironclads, and together with Gygax had collaborated on a Napoleonic naval game called Don't Give Up The Ship! Both games had a mechanic that allowed for ships to take multiple hits before being sunk, which they'd borrowed from the wargaming rules designed by author Fletcher Pratt in the 1930s. They borrowed those rules again for D&D.\n\nIn his book about the history of simulation games , Jon Peterson explains why hit points were such an important idea: “Hit points introduce uncertainty and variance […] In Dungeons & Dragons, even when the prospects of a hit are near certain, the damage dice provide another potential survival mechanism via endurance, another way of forestalling death and increasing the drama of combat.”\n\nLike D&D, video game combat discovered a new sense of drama with hit points. Early arcade games like 1978’s Space Invaders typically killed players with a single successful enemy contact, using multiple lives to prolong the experience. Replacing that with the ability to survive a set number of hits before dying added a finer-grained rise in tension. It removes the frustration of being reset to the start of a level every time a player is so much as brushed by an enemy, and as the number of hit points remaining falls your anxiety rises in direct correlation.\n\nBeing on your last life may make you cautious, but there's a smoother transition with hit points. You gradually shift between playing more carefully as you approach half-health, biting your metaphorical nails as it dwindles below that, and sinking into erratic risk-taking when only a sliver of life remains.\n\nVideo games inspired by D&D were the first to copy hit points, as far back as 1975 games and , which were coded for the system designed by the University of Illinois. DND was also the first game to have bosses, who could have hundreds or even thousands of what it called “Hits.”\n\nThe first official adaptations of D&D to PC were the “Gold Box” series begun by SSI with 1988’s . They followed the rules of what was then called Advanced Dungeons & Dragons closely, which meant beginning characters had very few hit points. Playing around a table there’s always the option to fudge dice rolls to prevent deaths from feeling too arbitrary, but the computer was never so forgiving and players got used to reloading frequently.\n\nGames that weren’t licenced had no such problem. The first Ultima began players with a tidy 150 hit points, and the second with 400. Important non-player characters like Lord British had totals so high that killing him became seen as a challenge , and by Ultima III players were luring Lord British to the beach so they could attack him with cannon-fire, as if he was one of the naval ships in the wargames hit points came from.\n\nArcade games tended not to represent hit points numerically, however. Memorably, in the platformer Ghosts 'N Goblins (ported to the Commodore 64 in 1986) Sir Arthur lost his armor on taking damage, continuing to fight in his underwear.\n\nOne of the first game to represent hit points with the now familiar life bar was , a 1985 dungeon crawler by Namco with a Vitality meter that changed from blue to red as you took damage from its bats, snakes, and “cave sharks.” While red life bars would go on to become standard, other ways of visualizing hit points have been tried with varying degrees of success.\n\n1983 ZX Spectrum/BBC Micro game had a slowly depleting roast chicken that tracked your starvation, and dinosaur fighter Primal Rage used veins leading to a heart that exploded at the moment of defeat.\n\nOther games have tried to make their life bar a part of the game world, as in first-person Jurassic Park game where it's a heart tattoo on the protagonist's breast you have to look down at to check. In sci-fi horror game Dead Space the life bar is represented by lights on the back of your armor, which would be very useful if you had a doctor standing directly behind you. Each of these visualizations is just a way of integrating a hit-point counter into the world, but in doing so they free the player from having to correlate a number with something that should feel real and immediate. They’re all still the same old hit points, under the surface.\n\n, a 1987 first-person shooter on the Atari ST, was an early example of both the deathmatch shooter and the idea of representing hit points visually. Each player was a floating smiley face, like a three-dimensional Pac-Man, and an icon of that face at the top of the screen became sadder as they took damage. Later shooters like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom would copy this idea, their protagonists' faces growing more bruised and bloody as they absorbed bullet after bullet.\n\nOn the next page: hit points through the 90s and 2000s with regenerating health and more twists from their D&D origins.",

        "articleBody": "Three cases of plague have been diagnosed in China, sparking widespread fears about the spread of the disease, though officials say the risk of an outbreak is low.\n\nAs Emily Feng reports for NPR, the first cases came to light last week, when authorities in Beijing announced that two infected individuals sought treatment at a hospital in the capital. The patients, a husband and wife, are from Inner Mongolia, an autonomous and sparsely populated region in the northern part of the country. They were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, one of the two main forms of infection caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis—the other being bubonic plague, which can advance to pneumonic plague if the infection spreads to the lungs. Yersinia pestis, per the WHO, is often found in small mammals and their fleas.\n\nPneumonic plague is the most deadly form of the disease. It is highly contagious, spreading from person to person via infected respiratory droplets. Without medical intervention, the disease is inevitably fatal. But recovery rates are high if it is detected and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.\n\nThe ailing couple was quarantined, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said it had conducted epidemiological investigations on people who might have been exposed to the patients, according to Sui-Lee Wee of the New York Times. All “relevant sites” were also disinfected, reports Wee. The CDC assured the public on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media site, that the risks of transmission were “extremely low.”\n\nOn November 16, a third case of plague was reported in a 55-year-old man, also from Inner Mongolia. He had, according to Alex Horton of the Washington Post, killed and eaten a wild rabbit before he was taken to a hospital around 185 miles northwest of Beijing. The man was diagnosed with bubonic plague.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that 28 people who came into contact with the patient were quarantined, and displayed no symptoms of plague—like the sudden onset of fever, body aches, vomiting and nausea. As yet, there is no epidemiological evidence linking the third plague case to the earlier two, the Inner Mongolia health commission said, according to Reuters.\n\nOver the centuries, plague has killed millions of people around the world, most famously during the Black Death, which wiped out nearly one-third of Europe’s population in the 1300s. Yersinia pestis is believed to have originated in China, spreading to the West via ships. Today, plague infections are rare, but they do happen. According to WHO, there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, with 584 deaths. China has experienced a small smattering of plague infections in recent years—26 cases and 11 deaths between 2009 and 2018, reports Reuters.\n\nThough the government has attempted to reassure the Chinese public in the wake of the recent diagnoses, many have voiced concerns that officials are minimizing or even restricting information about the cases.\n\nThe first two illnesses were confirmed on November 12. But according to NPR’s Feng, Li Jifeng, a doctor at Chaoyang Hospital where the patients were treated, wrote in a blog post that the couple had been transported to the facility on November 3—nine days before an announcement was made, raising questions about the reason for the delay.\n\nLi explained that plague cases need to be carefully investigated and verified, and announcements about them cannot be “transmitted casually.” But her post was still taken down by censors. Wee of the Times reports that censors had also instructed digital news aggregators to “block and control” discussions pertaining the news about the plague.\n\n“Don't hide things like this,” one Weibo commenter said, per Feng. “Let’s face whatever it is together.”\n\nCurrent fears about a potential plague outbreak are perhaps being fuelled by China’s handling of past health crises. In 2003, authorities there were accused of concealing the true extent of the country’s SARS outbreak—and Beijing officials ultimately admitted that the city had experienced 10 times as many cases as they had initially reported.\n\nIn the wake of that outbreak, China “vastly improved its detection and management of infectious diseases,” writes the Associated Press. And though the Chinese CDC has said that there is “no need” for Beijing residents to worry about the risk of plague infection, it has also acknowledged that remote regions of the country—like Yunnan and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau—are vulnerable to outbreaks. Officials have warned people to stay away from infected areas, and to avoid contact with rodents.",

He hasn't taken part in these negotiations.\"\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record label, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 – who reps the likes of Justin Beiber, Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande – has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29, however the “Bad Blood” songstress allegedly hasn’t been returning Braun’s calls, the source further claimed to the outlet.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT CLEARED TO PERFORM HITS AT AMAs AMID FEUD WITH SCOOTER BRAUN, BIG MACHINE RECORDS: REPORT\n\n\"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider added of the continuing spat.\n\nOn Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it possible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards after Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned company of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own the master recordings, at the AMAs\n\nThe statement, which was obtained by Variety, claimed that Big Machine and Dick Clark Productions had “come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platform.” The agreement maintained that it would not only cover Swift’s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\n\n\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed,” the statement continued.\n\nHowever, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to an agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that it had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\n\n“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the production company said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone. “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”\n\nOn Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big Machine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has been working on where her music was to be used.\n\nThe company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its website.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT'S FORMER LABEL BOSS BLASTS HER SCOOTER BRAUN 'BULLYING' CLAIMS, SAYS SHE KNEW ABOUT SALE\n\n\"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her tumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read. \"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward.\n\n\"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,\" the statement concluded.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSwift's rep told Fox News that this, too, was not the whole truth. \"Big Machine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them but, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes Taylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"\n\nA rep for Braun did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.",

        "articleBody": "If you’re like me and you don’t follow football throughout the season, you can always find something to love about game day — whether it’s rooting for the underdog, enjoying the halftime show and commercials, or just having a good time with friends and family.\n\nAs co-creator of the weight-loss program 2B Mindset, I want to help you enjoy everything about game day, including those delicious snacks!\n\nFootball food is “comfort food” — pizza, wings, chips, dips, and subs — and they can be very hard to resist.\n\nBut it’s important to remember that we’re fueling our bodies to watch football, not actually play it!\n\n5 Tips to Enjoy Game Day Parties While Staying on Track With Your Weight-Loss Goals:\n\nI know — it all looks so good. But you can’t eat it all, so it’s time to set priorities.\n\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks — those that are vegetable-based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so you’re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\n\nAnd you don’t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just can’t live without and leave it at that.\n\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if you’re drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\n\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because they’re there.\n\n3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\n\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we’re feeling especially hungry.\n\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\n\nThat’s especially true when you’re watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there — and without realizing it, you’ve consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying your food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\n\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\n\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you’re eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you don’t overdo it.\n\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don’t let your fingers do the walking.\n\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip.\n\nBut instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a vegetable instead.\n\nBecause let’s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that it’s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\n\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and you’ll see that you’ll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\n\nAnd don’t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip — those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\n\nHealthy Game Day Dip: Mix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories.\n\nEnjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you’ll get plenty of tangy crunch — without all the calories.\n\n5. Go topless (with your sub)\n\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\n\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you’re saving nearly 100 calories — about the same as a bottle of light beer.\n\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats?\n\nThis is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself “no.” That’s why I always tell my clients: “An open face is a happy face!”\n\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you’re out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks — without overdoing it!",

        "articleBody": "I mean, really … it’s the perfect job for an introvert!\n\nYou can do your work all by yourself without needing to interact with a single person in real life. Your computer screen provides comfort and cover from the world outside your doors.\n\nAnd despite the fact that you’re working alone, your business can flourish.\n\nYou have to be willing to be a leader.\n\nWelcome to a discussion about online leadership — and how to embrace it\n\nToday, we’re going to talk about how to adapt a success mindset so you’re able to step into a leadership role in your online business naturally and with ease.\n\nBut more importantly, I’m going to show you how taking a leadership role will help you to create a business you’ll love — a business that may not look like anyone else’s, but that suits you 100%.\n\nHere’s why stepping into an online leadership role is crucial\n\n“Pamela, why are we talking about leadership?”\n\nI’ve been thinking about leadership a lot this year. I’ve realized that it’s an essential ingredient of online success that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe sooner you embrace your online leader role, the sooner you’ll enjoy these benefits:\n• You’ll feel poised and self-assured while doing all the promotional activities that come with owning an online business.\n• You’ll become comfortable being visible online in everything from a published blog post; an email inbox; a webinar; a live video; a podcast; a stage; and inside the pages of a book.\n• Your business will grow, because the online world rewards people who confidently stand behind and in front of their businesses.\n\nI’m about to show you a path forward that even the most introverted among us can walk. It’s a way to gradually shift your success mindset so it includes opportunities to be the online leader your business needs.\n• Want to share your expertise with the world — but you’re secretly terrified to “put yourself out there”\n• Feel a deep desire to build a business that makes a difference but aren’t sure what it’s going to take\n• Wish you had tens of thousands of people in your audience — but are intimidated by those numbers at the same time\n\n… keep reading. I’m about to show you how to become an online business leader naturally and with less stress and fear.\n\nThis is the second article in a series about how to build an online business you’ll love.\n\nIn the first article, I talked about how online businesses are built in predictable stages.\n\nI shared a quiz that helps you pinpoint the stage you’re in now.\n\nThe BIG benefit of knowing your business-building stage?\n\nIt allows you to focus all your efforts on reaching the important milestones in that stage … and gives you permission to ignore the stages you’re not in right now.\n\nSay goodbye to that feeling of overwhelm you’ve been carrying around!\n\nRelated: Why Some People Triumph Online and Others Never Make It\n\nToday, I’m going to build on what I shared in the first article by showing you how to shift your “success mindset” toward growth. I’m going to map out an easy path to becoming the online leader your business needs.\n\nI think you’ll like what you’re about to learn. There’s a way to do this that’s not stressful and that builds naturally from one experience to another.\n\nMy goal with this article is to show you a way to become more comfortable standing both behind and in front of the online business you’re building. Ready?\n\nHave you experienced these “moments of personal growth?”\n\nAny time you’re building a business — online or offline — you’re going to experience some moments that cause you to … well, let’s say they cause you to grow as a person.\n\nThat’s putting a pleasant spin on it, isn’t it?\n\nMaybe you’ve experienced these moments before:\n• You’re putting together a first offer and then it hits you — “Oh, if I want people to buy this, I have to market it … not just now, but forever!”\n• You know that in order to reach prospects you’ve got to extend yourself. But yikes … outreach is so uncomfortable!\n• You’re given opportunities to be more visible — maybe it’s an interview request or a small speaking gig — and you’re terrified to say “yes.”\n\nIf you’ve experienced any of these challenging moments, guess what? You’re normal! And they help to form your success mindset.\n\nBut if you stay stuck in these moments and don’t move beyond them, your business won’t become what it can be.\n\nYour introverted side will stay cozy and comfortable, that’s for sure.\n\nBut you will always wonder, “What would have happened if I’d experienced the momentary discomfort and pushed past it?”\n\nThat’s what we’re going to cover here: a way to embrace a success mindset and push beyond the momentary discomfort so you can experience everything that’s waiting for you on the other side.\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s talk about the deep end for a moment.\n\nThere are a lot of people online who are pushing their solutions for gaining visibility in your online business. They’re selling:\n\nThese are all good things. They’re all things I’ve done myself! But if you take courses on doing these “deep end” things before you’ve done some of the “shallow end” things I’m about to share, you may end up feeling intimidated — not inspired.\n\nAnd sadly, you may never take the first steps.\n\nThat’s what I’m about to cover … the first steps. They’re crucial!\n\nRead on for three tips that will help you build a firm foundation for online leadership so that courses like the ones above feel like a natural next step.\n\n1. Start small and recognize that no one is watching\n\nWhen you’re in the planning and in the early building stages of your online businesses — planning your website and offers, and building the first-draft versions of both — there’s a helpful way to think about what you’re doing.\n\nImagine you’re in an auditorium in the backstage area, and the curtains are drawn. No one in the audience can see what you’re doing back there!\n\nYou’re planning and building what you’ll reveal to the world — but you haven’t pulled back the curtains and invited them in.\n\nHere’s what I want you to remember …\n\nWhen you do finally pull back those curtains with your heart in your throat and sweat beading on your upper lip?\n\nNo one is watching.\n\nI mean, if you’re lucky a few family members and friends are in your audience in the early days. But for the most part? There’s almost no one there.\n\nIt’s the perfect time to explore making yourself more visible. With fewer people watching your first visibility attempts, you won’t feel as intimidated by the process.\n\nSo start small and experiment! More on ways to experiment in the next section …\n\n2. Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1\n\nA few years ago, I was honored to be asked to speak twice at Darren Rowse’s Problogger conference in Australia. The topic of one of my presentations was creating online “events” that build your audience.\n\nIn that presentation I talked about how the online world gives you many opportunities to step out of your comfort zone.\n\nAnd I used this highly scientific graphic to illustrate the idea:\n\nIt got a good laugh! And I made my point, which is …\n\nIt’s smart to start with less-intimidating things and work your way up to the more intimidating things.\n\nEveryone’s list will be different. For me, the online visibility spectrum used to look like this:\n• Speaking to someone on the phone\n• Speaking to someone on a video call\n\nI didn’t go from the Non-scary stuff to the Terror Level 100 list.\n\nInstead, I moved from the Non-scary to the Kind of Scary stuff. I mastered the Kind of Scary list and moved on to the Intimidating list. I got comfortable with the Intimidating list and found myself ready to tackle the Terror Level 100 list.\n\nAll the while, my visibility increased. My success mindset became more resilient.\n\nAs you push into your next level of discomfort, you’ll find yourself being asked to participate in highly visible online events. People will ask you to write blog posts for them; appear on their podcasts; deliver the keynote addresses at their conferences.\n\nYou’ll have a strong success mindset and you’ll be ready for it all.\n\n3. Get support for the scary stuff to strengthen your success mindset\n\nWe already talked about how introverts can thrive online.\n\nWe sit alone at our screens, crafting information and messages that reach across the world and draw an audience to us … without having to leave the comfort of our homes, if we don’t want to.\n\nBut sitting in comfort stops you from growing into an online leadership role that will benefit you and your business.\n\nWhen it comes to moving yourself along the “visibility spectrum” toward a leadership role, it’s incredibly helpful to have a group of supportive colleagues by your side. People who share your dreams; empathize with your frustrations; and are generous with their support.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve reached out to colleagues and said something along the lines of …\n\n“Argh! I know I need to do this but it’s scary!”\n\nHaving a team of people around you that you can be “real” with is vital if you want to move yourself along that visibility spectrum.\n\nHere’s how to switch up your success mindset and become the online leader your business needs\n\nLet’s quickly recap what we covered in this article:\n• Start small and recognize that no one is watching. The early days are the perfect time to explore things that feel uncomfortable — your audience is small and you won’t feel as intimidated.\n• Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1. Remember, online leadership and authoritative visibility exist on a spectrum. Move along it step-by-step and your confidence will grow naturally.\n• Get support for the scary stuff. If you are truly committed to growth, consider joining a group where the other members will have your back and offer support when you’re about to take a big, scary step.\n\n“Become an online leader” sounds like a tall order. But it doesn’t have to be! Take it step-by-step and get support for the hard parts and you’ll get there before you know it.\n\nA favor: would you take a moment to share this information?\n\nAs I said earlier, I don’t see anyone else talking about how building up to an online leadership role will grow your business — and how to do it with less stress.\n\nI’d really love to get this information out to more people, so if you can take a moment to share, I’d appreciate it.\n\nComing next: how to make Plan & Grow BIG work for your business\n\nIn the final article in this series, we’re going to dig deep into how the Plan & Grow BIG approach to building an online business really works — and how to put it to use in your business.\n\nIt’s all about finding your starting point and focusing on the milestones that are just ahead.\n• If you’re just starting out, I’ll show you the path to take to get your online business off to a great start.\n• If you’ve already built your online business but it hasn’t reached its full potential, you’ll discover some new ideas for skyrocketing your growth.\n\nGo forth and lead\n\nNow you know a natural progression you can use to step into an online leadership role that will grow your reach and your revenues.\n\nIf you’re ready to build and grow your online business, check out the BIG League — my self-paced program for online business builders — and download the Online Business Success Roadmap.",

        "articleBody": "(CNN) President Donald Trump, according to the White House , made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed hospital on Saturday for a \"quick exam and labs\" as the first stage of his annual physical.\n\nYou shouldn't just believe them.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nWhich is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe even routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House who have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including the President's health -- that should force any rational person to question the explanation currently being offered by the White House.\n\nRemember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his most recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243 pounds.\n\nIn his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a common form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant that the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5 years, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic .)\n\nAt the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\n\n\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\n\nNow consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.\n\nSo, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the past.\n\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein.\n\n\"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\n\nSo, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n\n\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\n\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\n\nThis -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should you.",

        "articleBody": "Horgan and Delaney also dumped on Donald Trump, Piers Morgan, and Tucker Carlson in a chat with BuzzFeed News.\n\nSharon Horgan and Rob Delaney, creators and stars of the British comedy Catastrophe, have chimed in on the drama surrounding actor Felicity Huffman, one of several wealthy people arrested Tuesday on charges related to a massive college admissions scandal. “I mean, it's pretty amazing,\" Delaney told BuzzFeed News’ Isaac Fitzgerald, host of AM to DM, on Wednesday. \"There’s the horrible aspects and stuff that they used, like, special proctors that are to be reserved for kids with disabilities and stuff.\" “There’s a real nefarious, evil element to it where people actually suffer,\" he said. \"There’s that side of it, and then there’s the side where it's just terrific fun.” Both Horgan and Delaney did seem shocked by the $250,000 bond set for Huffman. (Her attorney had argued Huffman should be released on her own recognizance, saying her fame made her the antithesis of an “international fugitive.”) \"The sense that Felicity Huffman might be a flight threat?\" said Horgan. \"That seems a little...\" According to several reports, Huffman was met by FBI agents with their weapons drawn early Tuesday morning. Huffman and Full House actor Lori Loughlin, along with several others, were accused of various crimes, including securities fraud, corporate fraud, and bribery.\n\nHuffman is said to have made a $15,000 contribution to a fake charity in order “to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme on behalf of her oldest daughter,” according to a criminal complaint. Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 for their two daughters to be recruited to Universty of Southern California’s crew team, despite the fact the girls were not rowers.\n\nHorgan and Delaney weighed in on the controversy at the start of their AM to DM interview, during which they also discussed the upcoming fourth and final season of Catastrophe and how they knew it was time to end the series. “We’ve said what we wanted to say. It felt right, and we don’t wanna make stinkers,” Delaney said. The actor said he had a conversation with his mother about the decision earlier and said to her: “I couldn’t be prouder of Catastrophe, but if we did some bad episodes, I could be less proud.” Horgan agreed, saying, “I guess we got to end it in the way we wanted to, which not everyone gets the chance to do that.” The two said they’d be open to working with each other again, but as of now, they have no idea what that project would look like. Delaney and Horgan then played a game in which they decided whether the UK or the US had the worst — aka the more catastrophic version — of a particular item or person. When asked who was more of a catastrophe at their job — President Donald Trump or Prime Minister Theresa May — both Delaney and Horgan agreed on Trump. “I mean, she’s terrible,” Delaney said, “but she can also form sentences. She doesn’t have advanced neurosyphilis, so, like, she’s very awful in many similar ways, but nobody is as bad as Trump.”\n\nSimilarly, the creative partners were asked which political pundit was worse when it came to Tucker Carlson or Piers Morgan, and they both agreed on the former.\n\n\n\n“He’s more of a monster,” Horgan said of Carlson, whereas Morgan is “a fool and a minor bigot.”\n\n\n\nDelaney, on the other hand, was more searing with his words for Carlson, saying, “Tucker Carlson can suck my diarrhea out of my butt.\"",

That’s enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes.\n\nEuropa ― located some 390 million miles away ― is slightly smaller than Earth’s Moon.",

        "articleBody": "\n• If you're planning to retire early, you should aim to have at least 25 to 30 times your estimated annual expenses saved or invested, though that number may be lower or higher depending on the lifestyle you envision.\n• Depending on how much you plan to spend annually, you'll generally fall into one of three FIRE (financial independence, retire early) categories: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE.\n• To achieve your target number, live below your means, increase your income, and max out your retirement accounts.\n• You should also aim to pay off all high-interest debt before retiring, which may include paying off your mortgage early. And don't forget to make a backup plan.\n\nThe road to retiring early isn't easy. It takes time and incredible discipline to earn, save, and invest as much as you possibly can.\n\nThat said, early retirement comes in various shapes and sizes and what it looks like to you will determine exactly what you need to do to get there. In general, here are the steps you can take:\n\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live — i.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\n\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances.\n\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality.\n\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \"Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\n\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal — and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\n\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\n\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\n\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\n\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term solution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\n\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\n\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return.\n\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings — tax-free, at any time.\n\n7. Invest the money that's left over\n\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\n\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\n\n8. If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\n\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\n\nTommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\n\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\n\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it — would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line.\n\n11. Put Plan A into action — but enjoy the present, too\n\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you can.\n\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire, \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not all we do, either. It is important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those smaller achievements.\"\n\nThe worst thing you can do with your 401(k) when you leave a job, according to a financial expert and bestselling author\n\nHow to invest in index funds, explained\n\nA 401(k) can be the most lucrative way to save for retirement, so take advantage if you can\n\nHow to invest in real estate to make money and build wealth\n\nHow to withdraw from your traditional 401(k) account early — the strategies to avoid penalties and fees",

Those gains add to a major gain for shares, climbing more than 80% so far this year.\n\nMatt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, says the stock could be a risky bet with a worthy reward.\n\n\"This is a stock that until this year had been getting clobbered,\" Maley said on CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Monday. \"It was down for four straight years, down well over 60%, and the rally has only just recently broken above that multiyear trend line. If it can take it a little bit further and break above $13.60, that will follow that upward break of the trend line with a very nice higher high and will confirm that its long-term trend has broken to the upside.\"\n\n\"A little bit more risk but more reward because whenever you buy any stock in the early stages of a change in trend, it always gives you a little more upside potential,\" Maley said.\n\nThe Coty-Kylie Jenner deal could be the beginning of a new trend for consumer-facing stocks, says John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.\n\n\"Here's a company that's willing to pay for the eyeballs and the followers that Kylie Jenner has more so than anything else. So, this could be a new paradigm for the consumer staples, packaged goods industry which, you know, has been suffering because of weak mall traffic and the rise of e-commerce because shelf space has basically become infinite,\" Petrides said during the same segment.\n\nCoty acquired a 51% ownership position in Jenner's beauty and cosmetics portfolio, a deal announced at the beginning of the week. Jenner still has a partnership with Ulta Beauty to sell her products in its stores. That relationship began last November and led to several quarters of revenue growth for Ulta.\n\n\"I would expect more acquisitions like this going forward because it could be the new model for companies to acquire top-line growth by partnering up with key influencers,\" Petrides said.",

As you can see in the leak above from prolific leaker Chrales, Lucky Pokemon will also have their own special background in the Pokedex.\n\nAfter the leak yesterday, Niantic teased the incoming feature on Twitter with this picture accompanying a sentiment to players’ first trade.\n\nWhile I was in the middle of writing this article, Niantic actually officially announced Lucky Pokemon on the official Pokemon GO website, and confirmed that they can only be attained through trades, and that due to their lack of need for stardust, can “reach a higher CP much faster than other Pokemon.” Niantic also says that “the longer a Pokemon spends inside a trainer’s Pokemon storage, the higher the chance of them becoming Lucky Pokemon when they are traded.”\n\nOn top of that, Gifts will now have a chance to contain stardust when a player opens them, and trainers who send gifts to their friends will now receive XP for doing so.\n\nLucky Pokemon were actually quietly added to the game in the latest update on Android, and will be making their way to iOS soon enough. That update also gave players a way to filter and sort through their new friends list, along with nicknames and the ability to delete unwanted gifts. Niantic also recently implemented a new strike system for cheaters, and teased the addition of Gen 4 Pokemon during the Chicago GO Fest.\n\nLet us know what you think in the comments, and keep it locked to COGconnected for all the latest gaming news!",

        "articleBody": "Share All sharing options for: Gris is about the fear we live with, and finding voice to defeat it\n\nEver since I read Dune, I’ve kept a quote from it close to my heart, tucked away for times when I needed it most. If you’ve read the book, you probably know it as well. It’s the Bene Gesserit litany against fear, and part of what Paul Atreides learned on his way to becoming a hero.\n\n“I must not fear,” it begins. “Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”\n\nThat quote has given me comfort for a long time. At times, I’ve used it to visualize myself standing in a sea of turmoil, solid and immovable, while the flames of fear scour the land around me. In moments of stress and conflict, anxiety and panic, it has been a balm for rattled nerves and failing resolve.\n\nBut I realize now that there is another kind of fear. That kind of fear lives inside of you. That kind of fear can become like a poison in the mind and of the spirit. It is self doubt. It is worry. It is remorse and regret. It is so many things that can’t be washed away by standing still and finding calm.\n\nIt’s the kind of fear that stops you from simply doing anything.\n\nGris is a game that wants to teach us something about these fears we hold inside. It does so with a beautiful art style, a moving soundscape, and gameplay that, at times, flashes over into metaphor.\n\nIn Gris, you play as a woman (also named Gris) who has lost her voice and, with it, her agency. Her fears and her pain initially take the shape of a flock of birds that works to harass and punish her. She begins the game terribly weak, unable to even put one foot in front of the other. By the end, though, she’s become incredibly mobile and skilled. Hers is a journey to reclaim an intangible, inner kind of power. It is a journey toward rediscovering the self, and toward peace.\n\nGris is one of the most beautiful games that I’ve ever played. The art style is rendered as smooth, seemingly hand-painted watercolors that are light and airy on the screen when the game begins. By the end, however, Gris is awash with vivid color and movement. The art is not static like the technique used in Valkyria Chronicles. Instead, it works in layers of pattern and shape that become more complex over time. The art expands its depth as well, playing with parallax elements that both surprise and delight.\n\nThe gameplay as well grows and evolves, adding on little flourishes to its animations as new mechanics are introduced. So much of those mechanics are vital to the storyline itself, so I’m hesitant to spoil them all here. But let’s take just one as an example.\n\nLike the protagonist in Dune, your avatar first learns to become like a stone, standing firm against violent winds that will push you across the screen. If you’ve seen promotional art or trailers for the game, you’ve likely seen the main character flounce her dress up into a cube to weather these storms. It looks silly in still images, but in motion, the mechanic works well. There is weight to it, but also intentionality. Once you’ve learned to use that shape to survive cruel winds, then you’ll learn to harness those same winds to move forward.\n\nOnly by embracing those winds that have held her back is Gris able to reach new heights. What was once an obstacle becomes a resource, propelling you forward in the game. The analogy works as well visually as it does mechanically.\n\nGris is simply packed with little details like that, tiny things that, when considered, blossom into meaning. There’s a powerful feedback loop at play there as well. Even as I noticed more about the game’s symbols, I began to look for them in everything I touched. The environments themselves call out to the player, inviting them to pause and reflect on pain and loss and how to move on toward fulfillment and peace. You’re not simply moving through the environment, either. It reacts to you, welcomes you, and empowers you to think cleverly about solutions.\n\nGris will only take you a handful of hours to play from start to finish, but I can’t recommend it strongly enough. I only wish the experience lasted longer.\n\nDeveloped by Nomada Studio and published by Devolver Digital, Gris is set to be released on Dec. 13 for Nintendo Switch and Windows PC.",

        "articleBody": "This Is Us drops another HUGE fiery clue about Jack's death\n\nThis Is Us - Season 2\n\nThis Is Us - Season 2\n\nThis Is Us fired up the how-Jack-dies mystery again on Tuesday night with another huge hint about the manner in which the Pearson patriarch will leave this earth. While we saw Rebecca (Mandy Moore) grieving loudly in front of the family’s burned-down house in the season 2 premiere, and a lingering shot of the smoke detector lacking a power source in last week’s episode, this installment of the NBC family drama concluded with the most dangerous cliffhanger yet. (It was made all the more heartbreaking by coming after Jack and Rebecca deciding to go into business together and open a construction company, which they romantically celebrated upstairs, away from the home-office-to-be.) After Jack cleaned up the kitchen from the party that never quite happened and turned off the slow-cooker in the kitchen that you’ve got to fiddle with a bit — (neighbor George, what you have done???) — the Crock-Pot caught fire. As viewers heard The Cinematic Orchestra’s “To Build a Home” and watched a montage of Pearson memories made in this house over the years, flames spread rapidly through the kitchen and beyond, headed up the stairs, where everyone but Kevin was tucked away. Clearly, the end is night for Jack.\n\nThe episode took place on Super Bowl Sunday, with the Pearson parents trying to corral the Big Three into celebrating the big game together before the kids headed off to college and life threw whatever curveballs may come. (Apologies for the mixed sports metaphor.) Based on the information that we now know, this is the day that Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) dies. Many of the pieces needed for us to arrive at death’s doorstep have now snapped into place: Kevin (Logan Shroyer) got in a fight with Jack and Rebecca and spent the night at Sophie’s house (where he was that night of Jack’s demise, as we saw in the flashback earlier this season), while Rebecca was seen in that Steelers jersey, which she wore that fateful night as she drove by the burned-down Pearson house.\n\nIn the present day, Kate (Chrissy Metz) started to adopt a canine from an animal adoption worker (played by Lena Waithe) to put a smile on the face of Toby (Chris Sullivan), but when she became overwhelmed by possibly traumatizing memories of her childhood dog, she fled the scene, only to reverse course again and introduce Audio to Toby. Kevin (Justin Hartley) tried to make amends with those he had hurt during his addiction spiral, including ex-wife Sophie (Alexandra Breckenridge), but there was one name that brought tears to his eyes as he stared at this unchecked name: Dad. Meanwhile, Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson) gave Randall (Sterling K. Brown) some much-needed advice after they demonstrated differing styles over how to rehab William’s building: “Slow your roll.”\n\nYou’ll have to slow yours, as This Is Us won’t air next Tuesday. But fear not, the show returns five days after that with an episode that airs after the Super Bowl on Feb. 4 — and the promo for it that ran after Tuesday’s episode promised that it will answer all of your questions.",

        "articleBody": "Il avait été condamné deux fois à la perpétuité pour plusieurs assassinats. Le tueur en série Michel Fourniret, surnommé « l’ogre des Ardennes », est mort lundi 10 mai à l’âge de 79 ans, a annoncé le procureur de Paris, Rémy Heitz, à l’Agence France-Presse (AFP).\n\nIl « est mort lundi à 15 heures à l’unité hospitalière sécurisée interrégionale (UHSI) de la Pitié-Salpétrière à Paris », a précisé Rémy Heitz. Michel Fourniret, qui souffrait de problèmes cardiaques et de la maladie d’Alzheimer, était hospitalisé depuis le 28 avril dans cette unité dépendante du centre pénitentiaire de Fresnes. « Une enquête a été ouverte pour “recherches des causes de la mort”, confiée au 3e district de police judiciaire », a ajouté le procureur. Cette ouverture d’enquête est une pratique systématique en cas de décès en milieu pénitentiaire, et une autopsie doit être pratiquée dans ce cadre, selon une source proche du dossier.\n\nNé le 4 avril 1942 à Sedan (Ardennes), Michel Fourniret, marié trois fois et père de cinq enfants, se serait peu à peu transformé en prédateur sexuel après avoir découvert que sa première épouse n’était pas vierge. De son propre aveu, l’ajusteur et dessinateur en mécanique, père de famille discret le jour, se serait alors mué en « braconnier » à ses heures sombres.\n\nIl est d’abord condamné à trois reprises, en 1967, 1984 et 1987, pour une douzaine d’agressions sexuelles. A sa sortie de prison, en 1987, il s’installe avec Monique Olivier, sa troisième épouse, rencontrée en détention par petite annonce et dont il fait sa complice.\n\nLeur équipée s’achève en 2003 quand Michel Fourniret est arrêté en Belgique après un enlèvement raté. En 2004 et 2005, Monique Olivier craque et révèle aux enquêteurs onze meurtres, dont sept commis entre 1987 et 2001.\n\nMichel Fourniret avait été déclaré coupable en 2008 des meurtres de sept jeunes femmes ou adolescentes entre 1987 et 2001 et condamné à la perpétuité incompressible. Il avait de nouveau été condamné à perpétuité en 2018 pour un assassinat crapuleux lié au trésor du « gang des postiches », qui avait écumé les banques parisiennes entre 1981 à 1986 et amassé un butin faramineux.\n\nCelui dont les déclarations alambiquées et les problèmes de mémoire ont compliqué la tâche des enquêteurs, a été mis en examen en novembre 2019 pour la mort d’Estelle Mouzin, une fillette de 9 ans disparue en 2003 à Guermantes (Seine-et-Marne), et dont le corps n’a pas été retrouvé à ce jour malgré d’intenses fouilles menées récemment dans les Ardennes. Il avait fini par avouer en mars 2020 sa responsabilité. Son ex-épouse a été mise en examen pour complicité dans cette même affaire.\n\nOutre cette affaire, il était encore mis en examen pour les disparitions de Marie-Angèle Domece et Joanna Parrish. Deux meurtres qu’il avait avoués devant la juge d’instruction parisienne Sabine Khéris. Depuis décembre, il était aussi mis en examen pour la disparition de Lydie Logé, une jeune femme de 29 ans disparue en 1993 dans l’Orne.\n\n« C’est à la fois un sentiment de colère devant tant d’années d’inaction », a déclaré à l’AFP Me Didier Seban, avocat de plusieurs familles de disparues, dont celle d’Estelle Mouzin, soulignant que dans les affaires où il était encore mis en examen, il n’y aurait « pas de procès » et « pas de possibilité d’avoir les réponses attendues ».\n\n« Grâce à l’action de la juge d’instruction Sabine Kheris et des enquêteurs, on sait maintenant ce qui est arrivé à Estelle, mais pour d’autres familles c’est sans doute trop tard », a-t-il ajouté, appelant la justice à changer de « paradigme » pour enquêter sur les « cold cases », les affaires classées.",

        "articleBody": "As Major League Baseball's competition committee debates the impact of defensive shifts, lots of people have theories on why hitters have been slow to adjust and are falling into a depressed, statistically impaired state as hot shots to the right side routinely result in outs.\n\nThe list of interested bystanders includes commissioner Rob Manfred, who recently observed that hitters haven't adapted to the challenge in the manner baseball had anticipated.\n\n\"It was common thought, 'People are going to learn just to go the other way,''' Manfred told reporters at the MLB owners meetings in June. \"But the fact of the matter is the human element took over, and what they decided to do was go over the top rather than go the other way.''\n\nAgent Scott Boras has labeled shifts \"discriminatory'' to left-handed hitters. Come November, when Bryce Harper files for free agency, Boras will have a better idea of whether teams in the market for a nine-figure, power-hitting corner outfielder share that opinion.\n\nAre hitters simply too stubborn to adjust, or are the answers more complex? The potential hazards of a hitter going outside his comfort zone to beat the shift were evident during a recent Nationals-Blue Jays game, when Washington's Matt Adams suffered a broken finger while squaring to bunt against a vacant left side of the infield. As hitters also can attest, teams routinely pitch to the shift. A pitcher is not going to throw soft stuff away to a left-handed hitter with the entire left side of the infield uninhabited.\n\nESPN.com recently asked three lefty hitters who face varying percentages of shifts for their takes on the state of affairs. How do they try to attack defensive shifts, and do they think MLB can take any steps to address the problem -- if there is, indeed, a problem?\n\n\"Strikeouts are way up, so getting a base hit is more difficult than ever because of the velocity and how good pitchers are now. You see velocity and secondary weapons for four or five at-bats a game.\n\n\"It's really difficult to get three hits in one inning. If you hit three singles, it's one run. If you get a walk and a double, you might get one run. If you get a double and a single, you might get one run. So my goal is to touch second base every single time I step to home plate. If I'm not mistaken, somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 percent of ground balls go for extra-base hits. If I want to touch second base, I'm not going to be able to hit the ball on the ground. Pulled ground balls are not really base hits in this league anymore.\n\n\"I haven't really stolen bases for five or six years. If I drop a bunt down, what am I gonna do? I'm stuck at first base, so what I've done is ask our ballclub to get two more singles, or I've asked someone else to hit a double. If 7 percent of balls on the ground go for extra bases, someone is probably going to have to hit one in the air to score me from first. So what I've tried to do is hit a double every single time because it's really difficult to get three hits.\n\n\"If I'm not mistaken, the level of production goes: strikeout, popup, ground ball, fly ball, line drive. The production comes mostly from fly balls and line drives, so that's what we want. I'm trying to hit a line drive first. And if I miss, I hit a fly ball. Ground balls, popups and strikeouts aren't going to give you anything. It's not necessarily rocket science.\n\n\"I'm not trying to hit it in one specific place. If I look up, and they're full-shifting me, and I only have one defender in the 5-6 hole where the third baseman plays, I have to let the ball get a little deeper. But the pitchers are pretty good, and that's now a foul ball. I'm really never in the business of trying to aim for a certain area because I have to be perfect, and I'm not perfect.\n\n\"If any of us could control hits, we would get more of them. But you can't. You can only control the process.\n\n\"When baseball started, they set players up in the positions they did because that's where they thought the ball was going to be hit. You had the first baseman and the third basemen at the corners, the middle infielders and three outfielders. There was no rule that you had to have five guys on the dirt, a catcher and three outfielders. They just set it up that way because they said, 'Hey, this is where we think we're going to hit the ball.' It's the same thing that's being done now.\n\n\"The question everybody has to ask themselves is, 'Why are we playing the game? What is the goal of the game?' I think it's to score more runs than the other team. That seems to be what organizations are trying to do. They're going to set guys up there because they think, 'This is going to help us prevent runs' and 'We're going to try and attack the baseball in this way because we think it's going to help us score runs.' That's the name of the game. I think this has been a long time in the making. It's actually been quite impressive to watch how quickly teams have adapted to the data they've got.\n\n\"The reason they shift you in the places they do is because that's what your batted ball data says. I heard Joe Maddon say, 'You have three choices: You can try to hit it and beat the shift. That's going to give you a single, but now you're doing something against what you're best at, so the defense wins. You can hit into the shift, and the defense wins. Or you can try not to let the infielders catch the batted ball. No ground balls and no popups. Try to stand on second base.' That's Option C.''\n\n\"It happens so many times now, where a ball would have been in the 4-hole [between first and second base], but that isn't there anymore. Or you hit a line drive up the middle, and the guy is standing there. It's kind of the new norm.\n\n\"When I debuted in 2011, shifts were nonexistent. Now when they play you straight up, it almost looks strange out there. That's another reason why guys are trying to get the ball in the air. Ground balls through the infield aren't getting through now. The people upstairs who are putting players in these positions are smart. They know all the numbers, and there's obviously a reason why they do it.\n\n\"I used to try to manipulate my swing to hit balls to the left side of the infield and create some easy hits. I'll still try to do it at times, depending on where guys are positioned, but a lot goes into it. It depends on the situation in the game. How many outs are there? Are there runners on base? If there are two outs and I get into a 2-0 count and I hit a little ground ball to the shortstop hole, that probably wasn't as productive a team at-bat as it could have been if I ended up hitting a double somewhere.\n\n\"I've tried to bunt a few times, and I've had a few successes. But the third baseman is usually still in there for the first two strikes, so the bunt is not as big a factor as it could be. Again, it's dictated by the score and the situation in the game.\n\n\"It goes back to the question of 'How can I help the team the most?' Am I going to help the team the most over the course of the season hitting weak ground balls to shortstop [for a single]? I'm not a guy who steals a bunch of bases, so you're relying on a few hits to score me. If I try to drive the ball and I hit a double, it only takes one hit to score me. I definitely understand how people can look at it and say, 'Man, just hit a ball to the left side.' But there are a lot of different arguments to it.\n\n\"We've had meetings and talked about this stuff. If you're facing David Ortiz, and he bunts over there and gets a single, he may have just done us a favor. If we let Ortiz beat us with a bunt as opposed to him hitting a homer, maybe that's OK.\n\n\"As far as baseball doing something to change the shifts, that's for people smarter than me to decide. I just go out there and play where they tell me to play.''\n\n\"Think about which hitters teams shift against. They shift on guys who drive the ball. By trying to hit a ground ball to short -- which is the one spot on the infield where you would be able to beat the shift -- that's exactly what they want you to do.\n\n\"There's this whole narrative of 'Why don't guys just hit ground balls to short?' The answer is: (a) It's not that easy and (b) it's the complete thing you've taught yourself your entire baseball career to avoid. If a guy has a chance to hit a homer and a double, and he goes up there trying to slap a ground ball to short, the other team is perfectly fine with that.\n\n\"I think it gets blown out of proportion when people say, 'Just hit a ground ball to short.' You can't just take a 98 mph cutting fastball in on your hands and do that. Let's just say I sell out tonight, and I try it four times. The likelihood of me hitting four straight ground balls to short and ending up 4-for-4 are very slim. If I succeed once or maybe twice, at best I'm going to go 2-for-4 with two singles, where if I just play the game, I might go 2-for-4 with a homer and a double. It makes no sense to me.\n\n\"Just think about this: When there's a runner on third base and less than two outs and the infield is playing back, every hitter in baseball knows that all you have to do is hit a ground ball anywhere, and you score the run. And that success rate is still super small. That play is easy, and it gets screwed up all the time. Guys can't hit a ground ball when all they have to do is hit a ground ball to score a run.\n\n\"As defenders, when a guy comes up and hits a ground ball to short [to beat the shift], we still go to the same place the next time. It doesn't change anything. You look at the guys they shift on, and they're paid to drive the ball. People aren't doing it against Billy Hamilton and guys like that.\n\n\"When you look at where we're headed in baseball, the one alarming thing is the number of balls that are put in play. It's hard now -- period. Everyone is throwing 95 mph-plus with movement. Every bullpen has guys out there doing that. So just putting the ball in play and not striking out is a challenge in itself. If you already have all these disadvantages against the hitting side of the game, I wouldn't be opposed to getting back to playing the game the way it was always played, where you have two guys on the left side of the infield and two guys on the right side of the infield.\n\n\"I think the easiest way to do it would be for guys to play where they've played for all the time the game has been around. Two guys on the left side. Two guys on the right side. You have a designated area where the shortstop, third baseman, second baseman and first baseman all go, and you play there. That would be the simplest way. Is it gonna happen? I don't know. But if you're looking to help even out the advantage that pitchers have over the hitters, that's the only way to do it.''",

Thankfully, it seems to be contained to one store — at least 703 of those illnesses are from people who ate at a single location in Powell, OH (9733 Sawmill Parkway).\n\nPer the Dayton newspaper, the source of the outbreak has not yet been identified, and tests for Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli and Norovirus have come back negative.

        "articleBody": "The 2018 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show is getting some big changes in the mane department courtesy of celebrity hair stylist Anthony Turner. According to the hair pro, this year’s tresses will look more natural than ever on the Angels and supermodels.\n\nTurner shared his inspiration for this year’s hair moment saying that with the return of the iconic fashion show to New York City, he wanted the girls to look a little more downtown and real by embracing their natural texture and length. And the theme of this year’s styling? “We’re celebrating individuality — we don’t want the girls to look like a generic army of robots. We’re celebrating each girl for who she is.”\n\nTo get the downtown cool look for yourself, start by applying a volumizing mousse through damp hair. Turner recommends to start with a small amount of mousse, “because you can always go back in and add more if the hair feels like it doesn’t have enough grip once we start blow drying.”\n\nThen, add a small amount of serum-oil to the hair, applying from the mid-length through the ends of the hair to boost shine and break up the ends, so the hair looked natural.\n\nNext, blow dry your strands with the InfinitiPro by Conair 3Q Electronic Brushless Motor Hair Dryer. No brushes necessary, according to Turner. “We’re not using any brushes — we’re just tossing around the hair with our hands to help the hair look somewhat separated, which emphasizes the natural look we want to achieve.” Once dry, curl your locks with an Infiniti Pro by Conair 2-in-1 Black Titanium Styler, wrapping 1-inch sections of hair around the exterior of the iron, working from back to front with care that there is an even amount of curls all the way through. Another pro tip: start each curl a few inches down from the roots so the top of the hair remains smooth.\n\nNext, take the interior plates of the same styler to further smooth down any flyaways at the top of the hair and bevel the front sections away from the face. Let the hair cool and rake it through with a comb — et voila! Hair that looks natural, relaxed and cool.",

        "articleBody": "It feels strange that Fortnite was once a long-gestating game focused on defending makeshift bases from zombies. The release of its standalone, free-to-play Battle Royale mode felt like a curio at best back in 2017, an attempt to hop onto a trend. Now, in 2019, the mode has outpaced many of its competitors, leading to footballers performing dances from the game at the World Cup final and the elderly sporting game merchandise.\n\nStripping back the mode's meteoric success, and in an increasingly crowded space, is Fortnite still worth parachuting into?\n\nFor newcomers, it’s worth a quick mention of the basic setup of a Battle Royale title - one hundred players jump onto a map, scavenging weapons and items with which to eliminate others and work to be the last player standing. Fortnite doesn't stray too far from this formula, offering solo, duo, and squad based modes, but its execution of these basics is what’s impressive...\n\nWe'll be continuing to update this review intermittently to assess how Fortnite's patches affect the game.\n\nFortnite has been with us for two years and, due to its status as a ‘game as a service’, we think it’s important to update our thoughts on it.\n\nIn case you hadn't noticed, a lot has changed with the start of Fortnite's 11th season. For one, it's not called Season 11 - instead it carries the moniker ‘Fortnite Chapter 2’, and in many ways it does feel almost like a sequel.\n\nAt the end of Season 10, Fortnite's map was destroyed by a huge explosion, and swallowed by a black hole, watched by millions of players around the world. Those same millions waited days for any signs of life from Epic or the game's social accounts, and yet this period of inactivity only served to increase the hype levels - pretty impressive for a game that's already the world's most popular. It turns out that the one thing more talked about in gaming than playing Fortnite is the game being unavailable. How many games can dominate the conversation two years from launch?\n\nFortnite's new map will be what pulls in many lapsed players, but for our money it remains a variation on a theme. It retains the Dreamworks Animation aesthetic that has become so vaunted (and that helps it run on seemingly every platform), but the real draw here is the water.\n\nPreviously as deep as a puddle, water has been completely redesigned in Fortnite Chapter 2. For one, you no longer simply waltz through it as if it wasn't there. Players can swim through the water (preventing use of weaponry but potentially allowing for a sneaky getaway), while you can also use boats to traverse it. These feel much more natural to play with or against than the previously added planes and mechs, and could bring back many players that were disappointed with those additions.\n\nThere's even fishing, now, and while we have some serious concerns for the ecological state of the new map (being able to pull a shotgun or assault rifle from the bottom of a lake raises all sorts of questions about recycling), it can be a nice bonus when all you really wanted was a fish to eat for health.\n\nThere's more to enjoy in the map than just the water, and on land players are now able to hop into dumpsters and haystacks to surprise passing opponents. Perhaps even more excitingly, you can now use environmental hazards like exploding gas stations to deal serious damage to enemies.\n\nFortnite has always been at it's best when it revels in its own slapstick sensibilities, and Chapter 2 leans heavily into that. Aside from the aforementioned hiding spots, a ‘bandage bazooka’ allows for long range healing, while being able to carry comrades out of the line of fire is a neat new addition - help them up, and maybe they'll join you for a group high five (yes, there are group emotes now).\n\nOur favorite change for Fortnite Chapter 2, though, are the tweaks to the game's Battle Pass system. Whereas before you could go a whole match without completing one of the season's arbitrary challenges and therefore feel under-rewarded for your time, the game now offers seasonal XP and medals to help level you up just by playing the game. The challenges are still there, but those looking to just play a match without having to \"loot 10 chests\" or something like that will find the time they invest respected more.\n\nTo summarize, Fortnite Chapter 2 breathes fresh life into a game that's built on reinvention. It's gone from gaming phenomenon to mainstream phenomenon, and it feels like witnessing a part of history - just with more XP now.\n\nAs with any ever-evolving ‘live service’ game, Fortnite is constantly shifting. What started as another battle royale (albeit with building mechanics) has become a global phenomenon which is currently in the midst of its ninth season. With that in mind, we're re-evaluating Fortnite to give a more up to date perspective on the free-to-play juggernaut.\n\nFortnite, as we mentioned in our original review, is not only an excellent product, but one that rewards players regardless of financial investment. Someone hopping in for a handful of matches with friends will find just as much fun as someone who is grinding their way through the oft-imitated Battle Pass. All of this continues to ring true with Season 9, which offers the Gundam-esque Sentinel skin and the similarly upgradeable Rox outfit to start - and only gets more generous from there.\n\nEarn everything on offer, and you'll have amassed enough V-Bucks to buy your next battle pass - plus countless skins, decals, emotes and more.\n\nA big part of this new battle pass are Fortbytes, a new collectible that takes a little more work. Each one is numbered, and some are earned through completing battle pass challenges or earning a required amount of XP, while many can be found on the map if the player is wearing the required Battle Pass outfit. This helps Fortnite foster a rabid community that regularly works in tandem to solve mysteries - not bad for a player-versus-player title.\n\nOf course, a big part of such battle royale titles is the map itself and, as is tradition, Season 9 brings a wealth of changes to the bright and colorful game world. Tilted Towers has become Neo Tilted, a futuristic cityscape with a new digital clocktower and blimps flying overhead. Loot Lake's neighboring buildings are more modern now, too, while large windmills can be found dotted around Pleasant Park. Perhaps the biggest change is that of Retail Row, which was destroyed by Season 8's Volcano but now comprises a multi-level shopping mall which is perfect for ambushes and harvesting materials.\n\nThis is on top of new weapons which are constantly shifting and being rebalanced, as well as wind tunnels to allow for speedy traversal and new Limited Time Modes which rotate regularly mean that there's always some reason to return.\n\nAll in all, there's more than enough content to tempt back those yearning to complete some new Battle Pass challenges, but changes to Fortnite's map and meta make it a great place to compete alongside friends, especially since it continues to blaze a trail for cross-play and cross-progression. Being able to grind Battle Pass challenges on Switch or Mobile before returning to your console or PC to collect rewards still feels incredibly forward-thinking, even as other titles attempt to offer comparable services.\n\n[Below is our original review of Fortnite at launch.]\n\nIn comparison to its more po-faced contemporaries such as Blackout or PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Fortnite's identity is all its own. Both the characters and the map are colourful, with a vibrancy that belies its tactical depth. Whether you're playing on a PC, a Nintendo Switch, or your mobile device, the game not only looks great but plays well too - perhaps entirely fitting given that Epic are the creators of the Unreal Engine (a suite of tools for game developers).\n\nThe lack of blood and gore makes it more child-friendly than other shooters, and the whole thing is wrapped in a Dreamworks-esque shell. Whether it's jumping out of the Party Bus to start a match, or picking up items like a launchpad to send you flying through the air, Fortnite feels reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nThis personality filters down to the map itself - a hodgepodge of landscapes, from the urban skyscrapers of Tilted Towers, to the oasis-like Paradise Palms. Treasure chests are dotted around, each containing something useful, and Fortnite's reliance on a broader color palette than shades of greens and browns can make it easier to distinguish an opponent from a distance.\n\nWhile Fortnite still keeps its battles confined to a single map, variety comes in the form of seasonal updates and transformations which apply to all players. While one season brought about an ice age, another has added flyable aircraft.\n\nThese changes mean that the meta is in a state of constant flux, which may rile competitive players, but it keeps millions checking in on a regular basis to see what has changed. In fact, it wasn't long ago that the shooting stopped so that players could watch an in-game concert from current superstar DJ Marshmello.\n\nOf course, with this being a Battle Royale, it's unlikely you'll find much time to look at the scenery. Thankfully, Fortnite's combat still feels surprisingly fresh almost two years in, and that's primarily down to two things.\n\nThe first is the game's unique building mechanic, a holdover from its Save The World mode. By harvesting materials like brick or wood with your trusty pickaxe, players are able to build rudimentary structures with an intuitive grid-based building system. If you're out in the open, you might aim to create a wall to take cover behind, while traversing sheer cliff faces is much easier when you can construct a ramp, or a series of steps when descending.\n\nBuilding has long been a big part of Fortnite's difficulty curve, and it isn't uncommon to see the last ten combatants duke it out around a snaking series of ramps reaching into the heavens. The need to manage both building and shooting in increasingly confined spaces means Fortnite has a high skill ceiling, although it is entirely possible to brute force your way to a Victory Royale (something we're certainly guilty of). Epic's addition of a Creative Mode even allows for players to put together their own maps and custom game modes, adding even more to the longevity of Fortnite.\n\nA second key component of Fortnite's satisfying combat loop is in the shooting mechanics themselves. While it may seem strange to compare a third-person, cartoony battle royale to the developer's earlier work on Unreal Tournament, Fortnite's mobile, often strafe-heavy and \"loose\" shooting feels like it carries on that series' DNA.\n\nWeapons, for the most part, conform to standard archetypes of shotguns, sniper rifles and the like, but with Epic's commitment to shaking the game up at regular intervals we've seen weapons such as a Boogie Bomb, that causes enemies to dance, as well as remote-controlled missiles. Fortnite feels at its best when it revels in its own ludicrousness.\n\nReviewing a free-to-play title is a strange concept, because in Fortnite's case it can be easy to spend dozens of hours within its world without paying a single penny. Part of the game's appeal is it multi-platform ubiquity and the fact that it costs nothing.\n\nWhile there are many that would question the longevity of a title supported entirely by micro-transactions, Fortnite's paid items are purely cosmetic and often just as zany as one would expect from a title sporting such a colorful aesthetic. Character skins, dance moves, and new pickaxe designs are available, but Fortnite's greatest financial value can be found in its Battle Pass.\n\nCosting $9.99, the Fortnite Battle Pass allows for a steady stream of cosmetics that can be earned by simply playing the game and completing weekly challenges. These challenges are often a time for the community to come together and solve puzzles. Finishing one Battle Pass actually earns enough currency to buy the next one, too, and players that don't buy in will find their own stream of challenges.\n\nIt's now easier than ever to pick up your fix of Fortnite on the go. With Sony finally acquiescing and allowing cross-play between PlayStation 4 and the previously walled-off versions of the game on other platforms, it's now entirely possible to play with your friends across multiple consoles.\n\nPerhaps just as important for many is the addition of cross-progression. If you purchase the Battle Pass on your Xbox One, for example, the same challenges will be available to complete on your Nintendo Switch - perfect for checking off your rewards while on the go. It isn't just the Battle Pass either - all of your purchases and currency can be found on all of your devices.\n\nThere is a reason that Fornite is arguably the biggest game of the last decade. Its influence can be felt throughout pop culture as a whole because it walks the line of accessibility and that competitive spirit that many enjoy so much.\n\nBeneath all of the dances, the skins, and the Battle Pass, Fortnite Battle Royale is an excellently designed, ever-shifting platform of a game that respects a player's time whether they choose to spend money or not. There's enough of a learning curve to keep us coming back time and time again, while also being a fun place to play a quick game with a friend. It truly is a modern marvel.\n• Here’s what happened when we hired a Battle Royale teacher\n• Check out our picks of the best PS4 games",

This allows them to select which uniforms they want to wear, and they have elected to don road whites as opposed to their home blues.\n\nThe Eagles will be in their midnight greens:\n\nLast season, the Patriots were the road team against the Atlanta Falcons. They also wore white uniforms in that game, and you could say that things turned out pretty well for them after overcoming a 28-3 deficit — the largest in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe time before that, against the Seahawks, they wore white and beat the Seahawks 28-24 thanks to Malcolm Butler’s game-sealing interception at the goal line.\n\nOh, and the Patriots wore white the first time they beat the Eagles in a Super Bowl, back in 2005.\n\nAs you could probably tell by now, wearing white has been good for teams in the Super Bowl in recent years. In fact, the team wearing white in the big game has won 12 of the last 13 Super Bowls. All time, the white team has a 33-18 record.\n\nThe Packers were the last team to win a Super Bowl with colored uniforms, seven years ago against the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV.\n\nThe Falcons had the choice of which jersey to go with last year, so they can really only blame themselves for that devastating loss that Brady and the Patriots handed them in Houston.\n\nClearly, selecting white uniforms is yet another example of Bill Belichick and the Patriots always playing everything to their advantage and knowing the game better than everybody else.",

        "articleBody": "When my stepdad called to say that my mother was dying and I should get on a plane to come home, I hopped on the first available flight. She waited all day for my brother and me, sliding in and out of consciousness. When we walked in, she was propped up on a pillow without a wig, her salt-n-pepper, chemo-cropped hair on display. She said, with a wry, exhausted smile, \"You’ve had to wait an awfully long time to see me with gray hair, haven’t you?\" A week later, she died at age 64. When I think back on that week, most of my memories are of treasured moments, helping my mom transition from this life to the next. But the memory of her being self-conscious about her gray hair on her actual deathbed just makes me mad. Really mad. Why did this powerful, beautiful woman have to waste precious seconds cracking a joke to ease her embarrassment about being seen with her natural hair color? How have we, as a culture, allowed the definition of beauty to become, simply, \"young\"? And how can we shift it to something better now? I’m a doctor, trained to prolong life using modern medicine and preventive health practices. Are we really supposed to live in a frantic effort to feel, look, and act so much younger than we are? By being unrelentingly critical as we age, aren’t we setting ourselves up to feel anything but strong, happy, and beautiful? What if—and it is an IF—life provides us with the incredible privilege of getting older? How will we feel when we’re 64? What about 84? It’s time to move into a new age in the world of beauty, especially among people who have a tendency to be tough on themselves as age-related changes appear. Here are a few thoughts about how we can move toward a healthier relationship between beauty and aging. The journey starts in your mirror:\n\nThink about someone you love deeply. It can be someone in your daily life, someone far away, or someone you’ve lost. Close your eyes right now and picture some favorite moments with that person as you breathe quietly. All done? What did you picture? Did you imagine that person’s wrinkles? Arm flab? Saggy knees? You didn’t, right? You thought about how that person held you when you cried, or how he could know your mood from across the room, or how you two laughed until tears streamed down your faces. So why are you spending so much time focusing on your lines and spots when they will matter so little to those who cherish you?\n\nWe all do it. We look at others and judge them based on their appearance. We subconsciously slap labels on people as we move through the world: fat, old, sexy, ugly, gay, gorgeous, weird, skinny, stuck up—you name it. Those labels come with energetic vibrations, positive or negative, and those vibrations can be felt by all. Why do we do it? Do we feel better about ourselves when we’re critical of others? If so, that’s an insecure, unhealthy pattern. Is it just a bad habit? If so, let’s break it. Can you think of any worthwhile purpose it serves? I’m guessing you can’t. Criticism is especially prevalent among women. We are harsh in our assessments of other women, to no good end. What she does is her business, and she has her reasons for it. Focus on yourself—this applies to all.\n\nTalk to your partner and ask what’s important to him or her or them as your relationship progresses over time. Ask specifically if your appearance is important, and, if so, how? The answers might surprise you. If you’re single and worried that you won’t attract a partner without looking a certain way, consider the possibility that by putting your natural beauty on display, you’ll attract exactly the right kind of partner. Confidence is magnetic in a unique and compelling way, so don’t underestimate your power to attract someone by simply feeling comfortable in your own skin.\n\nAging naturally, without so many interventions, should be treated as an equal and respectable option rather than being seen as a person who has \"let herself go.\" If you are someone who chooses Botox and cosmetic surgery, do it because it’s what makes you feel like your true self, and don’t look down on people who choose otherwise. If you are an earth mama with gray streaks and smile lines, don’t condemn those who prefer more invasive methods. Consider your role in how people see and talk about themselves, and think about how to engage in more positive conversations about beauty and aging.\n\nI’m not saying all this is easy. In fact, I’m here to say it’s hard, and something I struggle with every single day. At 45, I am a new kind of tween. I feel young and vibrant and healthy, yet I see things changing in the mirror. I have silver hairs arriving daily, like gulls landing on a pond, after deciding to stop covering my gray last year. I have wrinkles from laughing and crying—badges of honor, to be sure, but also reminders of time’s ceaseless march. When I see myself in the mirror, negative thoughts often try to sneak into my head. When I see women whose faces are perfectly smooth and plump, I might feel a quiver of insecurity somewhere in the primal recesses of my brain. But with a bit of practice, I’m starting to acknowledge these thoughts and understand them for what they are: noise. It is time for a new age of beauty. It’s time to live in a world where people of all ages and aging styles are authentically celebrated and respected. It’s time we encourage one another to do exactly what makes us feel most like ourselves. Because those individual selves are the only things we have to offer this world—our laughter, our love, our ideas, our creativity, our tears, our smiles, our compassion, and our kindness. In trying to be like everyone else—or even look like everyone else—we deprive the world of our unique gifts, and we limit our capacity to love. It’s time to let our beauty shine in this exact moment of our lives, silver and all. Here's a French woman's take on aging gracefully, her way.",

        "articleBody": "LeBron James did something far more important than basketball on Monday — he opened a school in Akron to help the disadvantaged youth of his hometown. He relates to those kids, in a “there but for the grace of my basketball gifts go I” kind of way.\n\nThis undertaking was a massive challenge for LeBron and his non-profit, but it wasn’t the only challenge he talked about on Monday. When talking to the assembled basketball media, he discussed the challenge of lifting the Lakers back up to the status that franchise expects (and has been nowhere near in recent years). Via Dave McMenamin of ESPN, from LeBron’s interview with Rachel Nichols of the same network.\n\n“I like the challenge of being able to help a team get to places that they haven’t been in quite a while,” James said. “And obviously the Lakers haven’t made the playoffs in a few years, but the Lakers organization and historical franchise matches up there with all the greats. You can look at the Cowboys and you can look at the Patriots, you can look at Manchester United, the Boston Celtics — these are like historical franchises. And for me to be a part of that, I think it’s a great move not only for me but for my family and for the history of basketball in general.”\n\nAs for the team assembled by Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka — a interesting young Lakers’ core with Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, and Kyle Kuzma, now surrounded by some of the more interesting personalities of the league such as Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley, Rajon Rondo, and JaVale McGee — LeBron has high expectations.\n\n“We just got guys that love to play basketball,” James told ESPN’s Rachel Nichols as part of a wide-ranging sit-down interview Monday at the opening of his I Promise School. “At the end of the day, guys that love to play ball, and that’s what they do every single day, I love that. I love that, and I think [Rob] Pelinka and Magic [Johnson] love that as well, and that’s why they made the signings. And bringing Lance and JaVale and Beas and Rondo, they’re guys that every day that they wake up they think about the game of basketball. And everything else is secondary.”\n\nLeBron is 33, will turn 34 next season, and while he hasn’t slowed down much yet (he just picks his spots more), does he feel the pressure to win another title in LA sooner rather than later?\n\n“I don’t even look at it like that because I don’t feel like this is going to be one of the last years of my prime,” James said. “That’s another statistic number, and I’ve always been a part of beating the odds in life. So being around my kids a lot, it gives me even more and more time in my youth.”\n\nLeBron also said he gave serious consideration to both Houston and Philadelphia, before choosing to move his family to Los Angeles.",

The fast-food chain now offers a hand-spun vanilla milkshake that’s dotted with a rainbow of M&M’s candies. The different-colored candies make the drink look like it’s been sprinkled with colorful confetti.\n\nSecrets Fast Food Chains Don't Want You to Know\n\nIt’s still winter, but Burger King’s website urges diners to “cool down” with the new shake, which blends vanilla soft serve, M&M’s chocolate candies, and vanilla syrup, crowning the shake with a dollop of whipped topping.\n\nBetter not wait too long, though. A Burger King representative told The Daily Meal in an email that the shake is available only while supplies last. It’s priced at $3.99.\n\nWhile you’re at Burger King, you may want to further satisfy your sweet tooth with a treat that’s returned from the 1990s. A fan favorite, the gooey miniature cinnamon rolls called Cini Minis are back on the restaurant’s menu, also for a limited time.\n\nAnd if you’re still thinking about ordering that shake, sure, M&M’s are tasty and colorful, but they’re a relatively tame ingredient compared to many milkshake add-ins.

        "articleBody": "We're just going to come out and say it: Women can run, lift, plank, and climb as well as (if not better than) any sweaty dude sporting a cut-off T-shirt at the gym. Sometimes, guys just need a little reminder that being a woman isn’t synonymous for being a weakling. Check out how seven women reduced big, bad men to little boys—and just try not to spit your protein shake all over the floor.\n\n“I’m 5 feet tall and weigh maybe 105 or 115 pounds. I wouldn't know exactly since I never get on a scale. But aesthetically, I don't look like a bodybuilder and my petite size is misleading. So one day, when the squat rack was free, I proceeded to start my warmup. As I was getting ready to start, this guy, maybe 6’7” tall, comes and asks how many I have left. I politely let him know I was just starting but that he could feel free to jump in. I let him go first. As he racked the plates, I warmed up doing burpees. When he finished, he started to take off a plate. I politely said, ‘No don't remove that.’ He looked at me, puzzled, and asked, ‘Are you doing the same weight?’ I smiled and said, ‘No, I want to add another plate.’ I started to do my set. Before I even finished, he had left.” —Malvina P.\n\n“I was doing a fitness challenge at my gym about five years ago and was paired against another guy. Each of us were supposed to hold a plank, which I love to challenge myself in, for as long as we could. Going into it, the guy was told that my previous plank personal record was seven minutes and 30 seconds. So guess what? He holds his plank for 7 minutes and 35 seconds. Then, I held mine for eight minutes and 20 seconds.” —Kimberly M.\n\n“Shortly after we started dating, I asked my boyfriend to lift with me at my gym. According to him, he lifted every day, so I didn’t think joining me would be all that challenging. Little did he know, though, that he was walking into my territory, where chicks lift heavy and push just as hard as any guy. He ended up making it through about 20 minutes of my workout before he disappeared to the restroom for the next 20 minutes. He returned pale but ready to give it another go. Later that morning, he had to drive about an hour to work and actually had to walk backward up the stairs so his legs wouldn’t crumble under him. Today, we're married, and he survives the gym daily with me—but he still takes breaks in the bathroom while I secretly smile and continue my sets.” —Jess K.\n\n“While I was training for my first half-marathon, the weather forced me inside for more than a few long runs. About halfway through one, a guy hopped on the treadmill next to me. As I saw him peeking at my screen, he quickly adjusted his speed to exactly match mine. 'So annoying,' I thought. But I wasn’t going to screw up my pacing by trying to beat him at his own racing game. It turns out, I didn’t need to. About a mile into his run, he slowed it down to a walk, huffing and puffing like he had been doing an all-out sprint. I ran four more miles after that.\" —Christine R.\n\n“I don't max lift often, but one day when I was max lifting on the leg press, I started with one plate on each side. The guy on the leg press next to me had three on each. I caught him glancing at my weight and giggling. His giggling subsided when he stopped at six plates on each side and I kept on going. I continued to add a plate to each side until I had 20 plates total. No, I can't do this every day and only did three reps with that weight—but I will admit that it felt good to shut that one dude up. Who knows, maybe he helped me PR that day.” —Angela H.\n\n“My husband and I used to do workout routines from health and fitness magazines together. I would pull out my sets of weights and tell him to get heavier ones. But he usually ended up grabbing lighter ones like mine, resting more, and complaining. He wasn't a fan of my tips on his technique and form, either. We've done more separate workouts lately.

        "articleBody": "(CNN) Inside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s church in Atlanta on Thursday, the nation's first Black president -- who has acknowledged there was a Black president only because of what John Lewis sacrificed -- delivered a eulogy for the civil rights icon and eventual congressman that went well beyond pure remembrance.\n\nIn words that were both highly specific and at times more oblique, Obama declared Lewis' lifelong battle for racial equality to be ongoing and stated explicitly that forces in power today are working to undermine it.\n\nDrawing a direct line between the bridge in Selma, Alabama, where Lewis was bloodied by state troopers in 1965 and the protests this summer following police killings of Black Americans, Obama delivered his most forceful address since leaving office, casting the actions of his successor -- who avoided any in-person remembrances for Lewis, though three of his four living predecessors made the journey -- as corrosive for democracy.\n\n\"We may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar to cast a ballot, but even as we sit here there are those in power that are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting,\" Obama said, hours after President Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that November's presidential contest be delayed because of the unproven potential for fraud.\n\nAs Trump wages a reelection campaign reliant on racist tropes and a vague notion of \"heritage\" that many see rooted in an outdated vision of the country, Obama said Lewis would eventually be remembered as another type of national hero.\n\n\"America was built by John Lewises,\" Obama said. \"He, as much as anyone in our history, brought this country a little bit closer to our highest ideals. And someday, when we do finish that long journey towards freedom, when we do form a more perfect union ... John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.\"\n\nIt was a dramatic return to the political fray for a former president who has steadfastly worked to avoid becoming a foil for Trump, even as he frets privately and to Democratic donors about Trump's actions and words.\n\nBut it was also a deeply personal recognition of a life Obama admitted was necessary for his own political ascent.\n\n\"Imagine the courage of two people Malia's age -- younger than my oldest daughter -- on their own, to challenge an entire infrastructure of oppression,\" he said, evoking his 22-year-old eldest child. \"John was only 20 years old but he pushed all 20 of those years onto the center of the table.\"\n\nIt was the type of remembrance that marks the passage of a nation's history, provides a record of its highest and lowest moments and lays down a marker for the type of person -- the type of hero -- deserving of the country's attention and respect.\n\n\"When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something. Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part to help build what we called the Beloved Community, a nation and world society at peace with itself,\" he wrote, recalling his own lessons from King.\n\n\"It is so fitting on the day of his service, he leaves us our marching orders: Keep moving,\" former President Bill Clinton said during the funeral.\n\n\"He got into a lot of good trouble along the way but let's not forget he also developed an absolutely uncanny ability to heal troubled waters,\" Clinton added. \"He thought that the open hand was better than the clenched fist.\"\n\nWhile not at all unexpected, the absence Thursday of the sitting president was conspicuous. Remembering heroes was once something Washington could agree on, an idea that has increasingly seemed to be a relic from another time.\n\nYet however obvious it was, Trump's decision to forgo paying his respects -- which he declared decisively even before his aides could weigh the pros and cons -- was still a stark reminder of the rabidly polarized era of politics over which he presides.\n\nHe has continued to stoke a racial divide that Lewis spent his life working to bridge. As the country buckled earlier this summer under racial tensions and outcry over police brutality, Trump harkened back to 1960s rhetoric that wouldn't have been unfamiliar to Lewis, who was beaten and bloodied by police during the civil rights movement.\n\nAs Trump evoked \"vicious dogs\" that would restore order and used a phrase coined by a racist police chief in 1968 to warn that \"when the looting starts the shooting starts,\" Lewis encouraged protesters to continue the work that he started decades ago.\n\nThe comparisons to a darker era that many hoped had faded were made explicit in Obama's eulogy.\n\n\"George Wallace may be gone, but we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators,\" he said, referring to the segregationist Alabama governor who ran for president on a hard-right platform in 1968.\n\nIt's hard to imagine how those messages or that messenger would have fit in at Lewis' funeral. Yet political leaders have long put aside even their biggest differences to commemorate those few lives that can be said to have altered history.\n\n\"John and I had our disagreements, of course,\" former President George W. Bush said during the funeral on Thursday. \"But, in the America John Lewis fought for and in the America I believe in, differences of opinion are inevitable elements and evidence of democracy in action.\"\n\nSpeaking in 2015 at the 50th anniversary memorial of the \"Bloody Sunday\" march in Selma, Alabama -- an event that brought together Republicans and Democrats alike -- Obama seemed to predict an era of White nostalgia that would come to pass as a patriotic litmus test under Trump.\n\nCiting marchers like Lewis who were beaten by state troopers as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on their way to Montgomery to demand voting rights, Obama said that was true patriotism -- a stark contrast to Trump, who has decried protesters as un-American and intent on erasing history.\n\n\"That's what it means to love America. That's what it means to believe in America,\" Obama said of the marchers, adding later: \"That's what America is, not stock photos or airbrushed history or feeble attempts to define some of us as more American as others.\"\n\nHe repeated some of those themes Thursday, hailing Lewis' example as one to emulate.\n\n\"That's where real courage comes from -- not from turning on each other but by turning towards one another,\" Obama said. \"Not by sowing hatred and division but by spreading love and truth. Not by avoiding our responsibilities to create a better America and a better world but by embracing those responsibilities with joy and perseverance. And discovering that, in our beloved community, we do not walk alone.\"\n\nThat vision of America is not necessarily shared by Obama's successor, who has used monuments and statues, including those to Confederate generals, as a rallying cry in his reelection bid.\n\nBoth men have governed during times of intense racial divide: Obama reckoned with racially charged protests in Missouri and Maryland during his second term, and Trump now confronts ongoing unrest and outcry over the more recent police killings.\n\nIt was always unlikely that Obama would forgo the opportunity on Thursday to raise, again, the issues of racial disparity that continue to grip the nation.\n\nIn his speech, Obama listed a series of items that he said would make voting more fair and ensure every American is enfranchised: restoring the Voting Rights Act, allowing former inmates to vote, adding polling locations, making Election Day a federal holiday and allowing Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico to have full representation in Congress.\n\nHe also called for an end to the filibuster, the Senate rule that has allowed the minority party to stall legislation and that Obama called a remnant of Jim Crow.\n\nObama has used funerals in the past to deliver searing speeches on race -- most notably during a eulogy for the murdered pastor of a Charleston church that ended with a sung verse of \"Amazing Grace.\"\n\nAnd while he has openly attributed the possibility of his election to forebears like Lewis -- \"I was only there because of the sacrifices he made,\" Obama said he told Lewis at his inauguration -- he has also been frank that neither the fact he was elected nor the efforts he made while in office have been enough to combat still-existent racial divides.\n\n\"Thanks to him, we now all have our marching orders -- to keep believing in the possibility of remaking this country we love until it lives up to its full promise,\" Obama said in his statement following Lewis' death earlier this month.\n\nNearly every other American political leader in Washington -- including Vice President Mike Pence, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with Democrats such as former Vice President Joe Biden -- paid in-person tribute to Lewis this week in some fashion.\n\nTrump did issue a cursory statement on Twitter following the civil rights leader's death and ordered flags lowered: \"Saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family,\" he tweeted.\n\nIt did not go unnoticed that his Twitter remembrance of the late television host Regis Philbin, who also died recently, was nearly three times as long.\n\nIn an era of intense political divides, Trump's decision to avoid Lewis' funeral is not surprising. Lewis refused to attend Trump's inauguration in 2017 and declared him an illegitimate president. Trump subsequently said Lewis should focus on improving his district, calling it \"crime infested.\"\n\nWhen Trump announced unequivocally that he would not travel to the Capitol to pay his respects, some aides were caught off-guard because the issue hadn't been decisively settled on internally, one administration official said.\n\nTrump's distaste for the rituals of remembrance and tradition for people he dislikes have by now been well established. While he has shown an affinity for some trappings of his job, the President has little patience for its rituals when they do not revolve around him. Aides have said they have little interest in bringing Trump to places he is clearly unwelcome and could become a distraction.\n\nHe has shown similar disregard -- and at times open hostility -- for those idolized by most of the Washington establishment, at least in death. He was pointedly not invited to the funeral held in the Washington National Cathedral for Sen. John McCain, who was eulogized instead by two former presidents, George W. Bush and Obama.\n\nInstead of attending that funeral, Trump played a round of golf and, according to aides, sulked at the attention and adulation being mounted upon one of his avowed nemeses. Later, he complained that McCain's family never thanked him for approving certain aspects of the service.\n\nThe one prominent funeral that Trump did attend, for former President George H.W. Bush, remains the only time he's come face-to-face with his living predecessors since his inauguration. The encounter, at least by the looks of video footage, was chilly.\n\nThis month, Trump removed portraits of the younger Bush and Clinton that were hanging prominently in the White House and moved them to a room used to store tablecloths and unused furniture.",

        "articleBody": "A San Diego woman is claiming she wasn’t given anesthesia during an emergency Caesarean-section surgery in a lawsuit.\n\nDelfina Mota, 26, was 41 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to the Tri-City Medical Center in San Diego on Nov 15. to have labor induced. After hours of labor, Mota’s obstetrician, Dr. Sandra Lopez, made the decision to call for emergency C-section surgery after the fetal heart beat could no longer be detected, according to the San Diego Tribune. When the anesthesiologist, Dr. David Seif, could not be located, Lopez moved forward with the C-section surgery anyway, Mota claims.\n\n“Page him, keep paging him,” she told the Tribune she could hear the doctor saying in the operating room.\n\n“All of the sudden I felt cutting on my stomach … a burning sensation,” she said, before passing out from the pain.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Mota was “crying and screaming at the top of her lungs, that she could feel everything that was happening, and was also pleading for help.” The suit says that the anesthesiologist appeared in the operating room about halfway through the surgery.\n\n“I understand why they did it,” she said to the Tribune. “But this is a hospital… There should have been measures in place.” The baby girl, named Cali, was delivered healthy and is now about seven months old.\n\n“There was nothing they could have told me to prepare me for the screams that I heard and the feeling that I got when they started the surgery,” Paul Iheanachor, 35, the baby’s father, told the Tribune. “I heard the screams, the horrific screams. That’s when I realized they were cutting her without anesthesia.”\n\nThe hospital said it does not usually comment on pending litigation, but that Mota’s “public discussion of the care she received during her emergency C-section compels us to address this outrageous allegation. The patient was administered anesthesia prior to the surgery. We are pleased that the baby is ‘healthy’ and ‘happy.’”\n\nThe lawsuit, which names the hospital, surgeon and the anesthesiologist alleges “medical malpractice, loss of consortium, negligent infliction of emotional distress and assault and battery,” according to the Tribune. Mota’s lawyer, Norman Finkelstein, said in 35 years as a lawyer he’s “never seen anything like it.”\n\nAlthough the lawsuit does not include financial details, the claim the couple filed against Tri-City Medical Center prior to the lawsuit was for $5.75 million, the Tribune reports.",

        "articleBody": "Jean Castex a précisé ce lundi les conditions de reprise du sport, annoncées fin avril par Emmanuel Macron. Si dès le 19 mai, les enfants pourront faire du sport sans restriction, la reprise pour les adultes sera progressive, avec en point d’orgue l’ouverture au grand public des piscines et des salles de sport. Les courses de running et de vélo vont également reprendre.\n\nCette fois, on y est. À compter du mercredi 19 mai, les mineurs vont pouvoir refaire du sport comme avant la pandémie. Pour les enfants, la pratique sera autorisée en extérieur, en salle (ce n’était plus le cas depuis le 20 janvier), en piscine et surtout avec contact. Une excellente nouvelle pour les clubs de basket, de handball, de judo ou encore de lutte et de boxe, privés d’une activité normale depuis mars 2020. Si certains avaient pu rouvrir leurs portes, ils ont dû composer avec des mesures sanitaires strictes, où les contacts étaient interdits (même pour les jeux de ballon) et la pratique parfois limitée en extérieur.\n\nPour les adultes, la reprise va en revanche être progressive. Entre le mercredi 19 avril et le mercredi 9 juin, il ne sera possible (sauf pour les sportifs de haut niveau et le public prioritaire) de pratiquer une activité physique qu’à l’extérieur, comme c’est le cas actuellement. Les premiers changements apparaîtront le 9 juin avec d’une part la possibilité de reprendre le sport de contact en extérieur (notamment le football pour les amateurs, qui jusqu’à présent devaient se contenter de jeux individuels) et d’autre part de refaire du sport en salle, mais cette fois sans contact.\n\nC’est donc à partir du mercredi 9 juin que les adultes vont pouvoir retourner à la piscine et dans les salles de sport, où les jauges seront limitées à 50 % de la capacité totale. Dans les salles de fitness, le port du masque sportif, développé ces derniers mois, sera recommandé, mais pas obligatoire. À compter du 30 juin, les plus de 18 ans pourront pratiquer du sport comme avant Covid. À l’extérieur, à l’intérieur, avec ou sans contact. C’est donc à cette date qu’il sera à nouveau possible pour tout le monde de jouer au basket ou handball en salle, de faire de la boxe ou du judo.\n\nConcernant les activités libres de plein air, autorisées pendant le confinement, les contraintes vont peu à peu être allégées. La limite actuelle de 6 personnes passera à 10 le mercredi 19 mai puis à 25 le 9 juin. Ce n’est qu’à compter de cette date que les contacts seront possibles et que la partie de football entre copains dans un parc ou de basket dans les playground sera autorisée.\n\nLa reprise sonne également pour les compétitions sportives de plein air sur l’espace public (épreuves cyclistes ou de running…) mais de façon extrêmement progressive. Ainsi, entre le 19 mai et le 9 juin, les courses ne pourront accueillir que 50 participants maximum. La jauge passera ensuite à 500 puis à 2 500. Avec une contrainte, puisque le pass sanitaire, en vigueur dans les enceintes sportives, pourrait également être imposé au-delà de 1 000 participants. On pourrait donc, à compter du 30 juin, devoir présenter un test PCR négatif ou un certificat de vaccination pour prendre le départ d’un trail ou d’un marathon.",

She’s almost two.”\n\nThe Just Friends actress shares Flora with her husband, Carter Oosterhouse. Smart and the Trading Spaces star, who tied the knot in 2011, welcomed their little girl via surrogate in December 2016, after years of fertility struggles.\n\nAs a family, the trio are happiest when they are enjoying nature together. “We love to go on hikes, we love to walk on the beach,” Smart told Us. “We’re in the garden. We’re outside.”\n\nThough the former model is focusing on Flora for now, she and Oosterhouse, 42, are building an eco-mattress line called Smart Homes. “Right now she comes first,” Smart explained. “But I want to and I’m still continuing to work.”\n\nOccasionally, the California native is able to carve out some alone time to read a book or get a massage. “I feel like I don’t indulge enough,” she admitted. But Smart and the HGTV personality are good about scheduling date nights. “We go to dinners and see movies,” she told Us. “I think that’s so important.”\n\nThe pair celebrated their anniversary on September 10. Smart marked the milestone with a sweet selfie on Instagram. “Celebrating 7 years of love,” she captioned the photo, in which they are holding glasses of red wine. “Love this guy so much and thanks for making me a mama.”",

        "articleBody": "Right now the motoring world is practically wetting itself over the return of Toyota’s legendary sports car. We’re talking about the Supra of course, but there’s a promising designer at Bēhance.net that hasn’t forgotten about Toyota’s other legendary performance machine, one for which we should all be grateful. If it wasn’t for this car’s short-but-sweet tenure back in the late 1960s, the Supra may have never been born. In fact, it’s not a stretch to say all awesome Japanese sports cars – from the 240Z and Skyline to the NSX – owe their existence to this iconic Toyota. The 2000GT showed the world that Japan could build more than small hatchbacks, and the world listened. That's why you'll struggle to find an original 2000GT selling for less than $1 million these days.\n\nNow, it’s been reimagined as a modern machine in this cool render, and for the most part, we like what we see. There’s certainly plenty of influence from the new Supra, which isn’t a bad thing. Even though the car hasn’t been officially revealed just yet, the double-bubble roof and tiny rear window slanted upwards are straight from the preproduction models we’ve seen. The sculpted sides are taken from the new Supra as well, but the front is where the big changes exist.\n\nNestled into the gaping grille are the 2000GT’s trademark driving lamps, though if we’re honest, we could do with a bit more slope to the hood and a bit less gaping grille. Okay, a less grille. And while we’re at it, a bit more side glass on the rear pillars would really give this Supra-esque 2000GT concept a bit more individuality. That said, we love how this render also shows the designer’s sketches that evolved to bring this creation to life in the 3D world.\n\nThis rendering got us talking around the . Toyota is in the process of recapturing some of the enthusiast excitement that the brand lost through the 2000s. The Supra will certainly help that cause, but with BMW involved so heavily in the development, we can’t help but think there will be purists who denounce the new Supra as a badge-engineered Bimmer. We can’t think of a better way to silence the naysayers than to revive the 2000GT as a niche halo car slotted above the Supra.\n\nAre you listening Toyota? This is a idea.",

What 2 writers didn't have him on their ballot?,\" she wrote.\n\nThen, Verlander lost the award to Boston Red Sox pitcher Rick Porcello and in 2012, the baseball star lost to David Price, another Tampa Bay Rays player. Though in 2011, the new father did take home the famous honor.\n\nUpton has always been a supportive baseball wife when it comes to her husband's World Series-winning career.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in Italy on Nov. 4, 2017, just two days after the Astros pitcher won the World Series for his team. And despite all of their wedding guests already being in Italy for their destination nuptials, Upton made her way to Los Angeles to support her then fiance’s life-changing moment.\n\nBut the 26-year-old model isn’t the only supportive cheerleader in the relationship.\n\n\"I have been to some of her shows, but our schedules are so tough,\" Verlander told Fox News in March, adding that he loves to cheer on his wife when he is free. \"On my off-season, I try to get out and support her when I can.\"\n\nNow, the famous couple is working to balance their hectic schedules with a baby. The new parents recently announced the birth of their daughter, Genevieve Upton Verlander.\n\n“Welcome to the world Genevieve Upton Verlander. You stole my (heart) the first second I met you!!!” the proud father wrote, adding Wednesday’s date to the message – suggesting that the child was born three days before the announcement.",

        "articleBody": "Korean Blockchain/Cryptocurrency startup, Gameper Co., Ltd., has launched ‘Bitro’. It is a global app for trading cryptocurrencies with other digital assets in the P2P market aimed at helping the world take advantage of the special ‘Kimchi Premium.’ Bitro’ supports many payment methods such as mobile gift cards, e-cards, and mobile points.\n\n‘Freedom’ and ‘Secure’ are the two main values ‘Bitro’ brings to the P2P market\n\n‘Bitro’ traders can buy/sell bitcoins by setting a price above or below the currency price. You can either set a price or use a percentage to determine the price you wish to trade. A simple percentage slider is provided for easier interaction. If a percentage is set, the seller’s price will change according to the current market price and the percentage the trader has set. ‘Bitro’ will then calculate all the necessary information and provide the trader with a final price to be traded on. All you have to do is focus on the final price.\n\nThe current payment methods ‘Bitro’ provides are bank transfers, mobile gift cards, e-cards, and mobile points. But since trades are conducted via private chats, traders can use any kind of payment method they wish by mentioning different payment methods through hashtags or during a chat. Hashtags can also be used to promote your trade or add additional conditions to your trade.\n\nP2P markets can be tricky since you are trading with someone you don’t know online. ‘Bitro’ wants to change that by providing an automated escrow service with a tight dispute management team. Once a trade begins, the seller’s bitcoins are automatically escrowed. Then the trade proceeds via an automated chat sequence. You will be able to chat freely, but in order to progress the trade, you would need to go through the chat sequences. Think of them as instructions for a smooth and safe trading experience. Once the trade is complete, the seller’s bitcoins are automatically released and sent to the buyer.\n\nAll trades can be disputed with the ‘Dispute’ button if a trade does not complete, or something suspicious happens during a trade. The ‘Dispute’ button files the current trade into a dispute, and a ‘Bitro’ representative is contacted. Then the dispute team will contact both parties and review the dispute. Most disputes take less than 30 minutes to be resolved, helping to provide a seamless P2P trade experience.\n\n‘Bitro’ helps traders to make a profit by using the ‘Kimchi Premium.’ The ‘Kimchi Premium’ happens when Korean cryptocurrency exchanges have a higher price than most global exchanges. By using ‘Bitro,’ a trader can sell their cryptocurrencies at a higher price in Korea without the hassle of creating an account in a Korean exchange.\n\nCurrently ‘Bitro’ only supports bitcoins as a tradable cryptocurrency but will be supporting a lot more digital assets such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, etc., in the near future. Gameper CEO ‘ChesterLee’ sees ‘the crypto/Blockchain market becoming more regulated, which is positive for the market and will help expand the global market in general. ‘Bitro’ is available on both iOS and Android devices.",

        "articleBody": "There are so many reasons why Fido is considered man’s best friend- no one will ever be happier to see you when you walk through the front door every day, or listen to you for hours on end without a complaint. There’s no doubt that dogs help contribute to better health, which we highlighted in this article. Therapy and service dogs in particular play a special role in society, helping their owners function daily and make life easier for them.\n\nHere are the Top 10 from Health Fitness Revolution and author of the book ReSYNC Your Life Samir Becic:\n• Helps people overcome speech disorders: People with dysarthria lack muscle coordination in speech movement. Therapy dogs can help with this by increasing the attention span and improving coordination.\n• Anxiety relief: Therapy dogs can help patients suffering from disorders such as anxiety, severe disruptive behavioral disorder, ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), and ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder). Studies have shown that when we touch dogs, it has a healing power because hormones like dopamine and beta-endorphin are released.\n• Aid with dementia: Often if the elderly develop dementia, therapy dogs are able to provide aid by assisting with simple tasks. These tasks include such things as retrieving items, walking with the those afflicted, and by providing support for those in their care mentally and physically.\n• Encourage communication: Dogs have a wonderful way of connecting with people by putting them at ease. Dogs can sense human vocalization and gestures. It’s been shown that people who have difficulty communicating often find it easier to do so with a dog, due to their ability to listen but not respond or criticize.\n• Help with autistic children: Dogs give something to talk about between autistic children and their parents. They provide a non-judgemental medium to communicate and have a common area of interest while also allowing them to benefit from the aforementioned ability to encourage communication.\n• Physiological benefits: Therapy dogs can reduce blood pressure and help the patient relax in a more comfortable setting. A dog’s sense of touch can automatically send a positive receptor, such as a warm sensation between the human and animal. This is a rewarding way to calm the patient who may suffer from anxiety.\n• Helps around household: Therapy dogs are certified trained to retrieve medication for the patient, answer the doorbell, and to respond quickly to a smoke detector if the patient is unresponsive. These dogs are called animal- assisted therapy trained dogs\n• Promotes socializing: A study by Harvard shows that dogs are not only good companions themselves, they can also help create human-to-human friendships and social support, both of which are good for long-term health. People with dogs are 60% more likely to meet new people!\n• Different types of therapy dogs to fit various needs: With each patient, there’s a different type of therapy dog trained to be suited for the different needs of that person. The first is the “Therapeutic Visitation” dog, these are regular dogs who are taken by their owners to Rehabilitation clinics, retirement homes and hospitals. The Next type is the “Animal Assisted Therapy” dog which helps its people in rehabilitation clinics reacquire their fine motor skills. Finally is the “Facility Therapy” dog who is tasked with helping seniors and dementia patients.\n• Promote exercise: Having a therapy dog can increase your willingness to exercise and improve your motor skills. It is healthy for both the owner and/or patient and dog to take frequent walks, which enables you to go out and enjoy the fresh air and reap the benefits of communing in nature and those associated with exercise.",
