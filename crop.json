        "articleBody": "The Steelers spent Monday trying to distance themselves from Thursday night's fight that led to multi-game suspensions for Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett and Pittsburgh center Maurkice Pouncey. Cleveland DL Larry Ogunjobi also received a one-game suspension for shoving Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph to the ground, and both teams received $250,000 fines.\n\nBrowns DL Sheldon Richardson, however, decided to weigh in on Thursday's fight on Monday, saying that Rudolph should be disciplined by the league for his role in the fight. Rudolph and Garrett engaged in a heated altercation before Garrett hit Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's helmet.\n\nRichardson, via USA Today, said that Rudolph \"can't antagonize a fight and then claim bullying. … You get what's coming to you. He was protecting himself. I don't blame him. Guy keeps rushing me, even with the helmet off, he's asking for it. Just leave it at that.\"\n\nCBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has reported that the NFL will fine Rudolph for his role in the fight. Rudolph's role in the fight and whether he deserves any type of punishment was a hot button topic in the days immediately following the fight. Those in favor of punishment have said that Rudolph instigated the fight by igniting the altercation with Garrett when the two were on the ground. Rudolph then tried to remove Garrett's helmet before Garrett responded by hitting Rudolph in the head with his own helmet. Rudolph's supporters have stated that Rudolph had no choice but to act after Garrett remained on top of him well after Rudolph had thrown the ball to running back Trey Edmunds.\n\nWhile Richardson wants Rudolph to be disciplined, Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward, who openly lobbied for the league to suspend Garrett on Thursday night, did not offer a response when asked about the league's decision to suspend Garrett for the remainder of the season. Heyward said that he is more focused on helping the Steelers right the ship after seeing their four-game winning streak come to an end.\n\n\"The most important thing is we lost that game,\" Heyward said, via Brian Batko of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"I know it got overshadowed by a lot of things, but as a defense, we didn't play well. We were on the field too much. That's our fault. They drove the ball and had a lot of success. You've got to learn from that. I'm not going to hide away from that.\"\n\nThe Steelers and Browns were in the news for a different reason on Monday, as the NFL decided to move the teams' Week 13 rematch in Pittsburgh from a 4:25 kickoff to a 1 p.m. start. Heyward said that he is already looking forward to facing the Browns again.\n\n\"I like the fact that we lost to them, so we get another shot to play them. I don't care who we lose to, if they're in our division, we get our shot [again],\" Heyward said. \"We've got to right the ship. I know we get them at home, and we're thinking we have this great aura at Heinz Field, but we've got to put in the work. Only way that game means anything is if we win this game, so our focus has got to be on Cincinnati right now.\"",

        "articleBody": "Police released dramatic video showing the rescue of a 8-year-old Fort Worth girl who was ripped from her mother's arms and kidnapped in broad daylight. CBS DFW reports the man who kidnapped the child, Michael Webb, was sentenced to life in federal prison.\n\nIn a three-hour recorded interview with the FBI, Webb confessed to the kidnapping, admitting that after successfully fighting off the child's mother, he drove to a church parking lot. Later that evening, he admitted that he took the child to Forest Hill's WoodSpring Suites hotel, where he carried the her into a room and held her captive.\n\nIt was around midnight when a tip led Forest Hill police officers to Webb's room. Shortly before their arrival, Webb admitted to threatening the girl, and hiding the girl from law enforcement in a small laundry basket. The officers, having visually inspected the room, left without finding the child.\n\nMeanwhile, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement canvassed the city of Fort Worth looking for the missing girl. It was ultimately the efforts of a family friend who spotted Webb's Ford sedan and called 911. Fort Worth Police Department responded and confirmed that there appeared to be blood on the front passenger seat. Law enforcement then acted quickly to gain entry into the hotel room, rescuing the victim who was found hidden in the laundry basket.\n\nThe video shows the tense moments heavily armed officers rammed the door, and Webb eventually came out naked.\n\n\"We got her, we got her!\" officers announced on their radios. \"He's in custody; we have her.\"\n\nFollowing a two-day trial in September, a federal jury in Fort Worth deliberated for less than 10 minutes before convicting Webb, 51, of kidnapping the girl.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Webb grabbed the little girl as she and her mother were walking down Fort Worth's 6th Avenue at 6:38 p.m. on Saturday, May 18. Neighborhood surveillance video shows the victim's mother knocked to the ground as Webb's car drives away.\n\nThe victim's mother testified, describing her daughter as \"brave, strong, and smart\" before describing for the jury the horrific details of the \"physical fight\" for her daughter's life.\n\n\"We believe that justice has been served in this case. And we are thankful for and agree with the Judge's decision to sentence him to life in prison. My hope is that this family and this community will find solace in knowing that he will never be able to harm another little child again,\" said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox.",

        "articleBody": "The latest wave of tech-based financial startups have a new angle on the banking sector: They’ll assume that everyone is out of money, then try to monetize their brokeness.\n\nSo-called neo-banks, or challenger banks, have been all the rage in Europe and Australia for the past few years. Now they’re starting to get attention here in the US, with names like Chime, Varo, SoFi, Current, GoBank, and even—heaven help us— booyah!. Yes, the exclamation point is part of the name. Like Yahoo!. Cutting edge, I know.\n\nThese neo-banks have been trying to make money in the usual ways: By taking a cut of credit or debit card transactions, collecting interest on consumer deposits, and making loans. The usual banking stuff.\n\nTheir come-on is that they’re super-convenient, all-digital, mobile alternatives to the big banks. Better yet, they’re focused on their customers’ “financial health,” as one neo-bank CEO told me, and easing the “pain” that people feel around their money.\n\nWhat makes that pain go away? At Chime and Varo, you can get what sounds a little like a neo–payday loan—your paycheck cashed, up to two days before your actual payday. Checking accounts at these startups are often free, and the companies will let you go $50 or $100 into the red before they start charging any overdraft fees. Some have automated savings accounts that invisibly funnel a few dollars from your paycheck into savings.\n\nThese neo-banks aren’t necessarily even banks at all; some are apps that facilitate transactions, which are then carried out by partners that are banks. Others have applied for bank charters while touting their homegrown technology stacks and hyperpersonalized product offerings (based, of course, on your personal data). But all of them say, explicitly or by intimation, that they’re mission-driven. Their mission is the hot mess that is your finances.\n\nThe hot mess is very real. Seventy-eight percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Student loan obligations in this country total $1.5 trillion, and researchers believe they’re cutting into millennials’ ability to buy homes, have kids, and save for retirement. More than 40 percent of households have some credit card debt: The average liability is more than $5,000, and the poorer you are, the more you’re likely to have.\n\nSo what better fix than to slap a slick veneer of tech over basic banking services, push the ouroboros paycheck cycle up by a couple of days, offer some basic budgeting tools, and call it a revolution in consumer banking?\n\nBetter banking isn’t a bad idea, nor is it a tough sell. There’s definitely an ambient frustration with the megabanks that have destroyed the global economy, bilked consumers with fake accounts and hidden terms, propped themselves up on the comfortable elbow of your overdraft fees, routinely discriminated against people of color, and on and on and on. I mean, there really should be a mission to take customers away from these companies. At minimum, it’s smart to capitalize on all of this well-earned consumer rage.\n\nStill, it’s deeply depressing to attend a large gathering of executives, founders, and industry veterans, as I did at October’s Money 20/20 conference, and hear the same, somber message repeated over and over again: The future of money will be predicated on the fact that the personal finances of the next generation are as fragile as a Fabergé egg. This, according to attendees and speakers, is both a problem and an opportunity. No one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation’s finances isn’t technology’s problem to solve.\n\nIn fact, the idea that the solution to our financial woes can be found in a more convenient, higher-tech, friendlier-named digital bank feels a little like the last story we heard from the tech industry: That the very idea of work could be disrupted by a bunch of apps, too.\n\nNo one bothered mentioning that the sick state of the nation’s finances isn’t technology’s problem to solve.\n\nThe same business logic—that you’re trapped in a sad, hellish existence dictated by megacorporations, and tech can free you like Neo from the Matrix—underlies the entire gig economy. It’s the basis for another tech veneer, this one layered over people’s inability to find meaningful work for reasonable pay. Uber got into the financial services game recently, with Uber Money. The headline feature? Real-time earnings for drivers and delivery people, so they can collect immediately, instead of weekly.\n\nIn fact, we can use the evolution of the gig economy as a case study for how the latest wave of banking disruption might play out.\n\nThere was a lot that was appealing about the gig economy at first. Those Uber “side hustle” commercials were super cool back in 2016, when driving for Uber or Lyft or Postmates, or shopping for TaskRabbit or letting out a room on Airbnb to cover your hiked-up rent, actually seemed like an opportunity rather than a necessity. Remember when this was about making “extra” money, instead of just barely enough?\n\nIt was only scale, and the hard realities of American economics, that made these things look a little less consumer-friendly a few years later. As Uber and Lyft grew, driver pay went down. Word got out that unicorn-like businesses could be built by replacing paid employees with a massive network of independent contractors. The model spread. Enter Lugg, Instacart, DoorDash, GrubHub, Prime Now, and Homejoy.\n\nThis phalanx of apps comprises an army of independent contractors who hope for enough tips to make their labor worthwhile. As their finances have cracked under the strain of small checks, no benefits, and a near-total lack of retirement savings, I guess it was only a matter of time before a fresh set of apps—the neo-banks—were deployed amid the chaos.\n\nI’d like to think the mission-driven companies flooding into the US market for financial services will be better for consumers. In the short term, that seems plausible. Cool features, fewer fees, and a helpful person on the phone or online chat could make us happy. Let’s not forget, many people really hate big banks and would rather take their business elsewhere.\n\nBut there are two problems with this potential disruption.\n\nOne, it might not end up being so consumer-friendly in the long run. Uber and Lyft ended up paying drivers less as their revenue pressure grew, and they’re raising prices for consumers. Many riders will tell you the quality of the driving, the cars, and the experience has declined over time, which is both inevitable with growth and not surprising given the shrinking pay and incentives.\n\nThat will almost certainly also be the case with these neo-banks. Banks won’t lie down and let the disruption happen—they’ll almost certainly buy some of these upstarts and reabsorb reluctant customers. Big Tech incumbents are already honing in on the space. Apple’s (issue-laden) credit card, Amazon’s small business loans and unknown future ambitions, Google’s forthcoming consumer checking accounts, and Facebook’s payment wallets could all eat into the market for new companies.\n\nWhether it’s due to competition from banks, each other, or bigger tech companies, neo-bank startups will inevitably go out of business, leaving consumers stranded. That’s pretty disruptive when you’re talking about your checking account. And at some point, the neo-banks will have to make more money, which means their offerings will get less generous over time.\n\nA second problem is more serious. Ultimately, no amount of friendly design, accessible features, and overdraft protections will solve the underlying problems that made these services necessary in the first place. No neo-bank can erase the student loan debt or the 40-year stagnation in wages or the unexpected medical expenses or the crippling reality of America’s existential brokeness. The neo-banks have promised that they’ll ease your pain, but that’s just morphine for the real condition. When it comes to the actual sickness, you’re still on your own.",

        "articleBody": "As of 29 November 2018, thirty artworks will light up the city center of Amsterdam for the seventh year in a row. For this years’ edition of Amsterdam Light Festival artists, designers and architects from sixteen different countries share their interpretation of the central theme ‘The Medium is the Message’. All participating artworks will be lit simultaneously during the 53-day-long festival. There will be one exhibition – in the historical center of Amsterdam – which can be experienced in different ways: by boat, by bike or on foot. This year, for the very first time, visitors can vote for their favorite light artwork. The Public Award will be presented to the artist of the winning artwork in the last weekend of the festival. Amsterdam Light Festival can be enjoyed until 20 January 2019.\n\nCover image: artist’s impression of the lighting installation by Peter Koros Design at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n\nA selection of the participating artists and artworks:\n\nIvana Jelić and Pavle Petrović (Serbia) found inspiration for their work Starry Night in Van Gogh’s famous painting of the same name. Since the beginning of the 21st century, as a result of the increase in light pollution, starry nights are less and less visible in urban areas. With the installation Starry Night, the Serbian duo gives Amsterdam its (artificial) starry night back, which reminds us of what we are missing out on.\n\nGroupe LAPS (France) produces movies and (multi)media installations and often integrates the urban surrounding into their work. Exclusively for the festival, the French artist collective designed Spider on the Bridge: eighty spiders of two meters each, which together form one gigantic spider on the bridge between the Herengracht and Amstel. Light effects give the illusion that the creatures are crawling all over each other. Arachnophobic visitors are warned!\n\nAmigo & amigo (Australia) – also known as Renzo B. Larriviere and Simone Chua – explores the relationship between sculptures and light with their technically complex artworks. Parabolic Lightcloud is a cloud of light made with impressive colors, patterns, and transitions. With this installation, the duo tries to picture human emotions and stimulate visitors to think about the impact of external impulses on our feelings and instincts. Moreover: the installation consists of 1.000 led lights and 800 meters of rope made out of recycled plastic from discarded bottles.\n\nOGE Group (Israel) is an expert on light art, the founders Merav Eitan and Gaston Zahr are the artistic directors of Jerusalem Light Festival. Their work is characterized by the powerful way in which it arouses emotions, with Light a Wish as a clear example of that. The artwork pictures the moment you blow the fluff off a dandelion and make a wish while it scatters in the air. Eitan and Zahr cherish this childhood memory by making the dandelions float above de Herengracht, where everyone can make a wish during the festival.\n\nBalmond Studio (United Kingdom) has become a friend of the festival. The studio’s innovative artworks are inspired by science, math, and biology. With Optilli, Balmond Studio creates an optical illusion and shows the subjective way our brain processes light as a source of information. As soon as the light is converted into impulses, our brain produces an image. The question is: is the displayed image correct?\n\nLight as a medium, and remarkable stories about Amsterdam\nFrom hundreds of submitted concepts, the festival jury selected thirty artworks. This years’ exhibition revolves around the theme ‘The Medium is the Message ‘, the famous statement by the Canadian scientist and philosopher Marshall McLuhan. The idea behind his statement was simple: the way we send a message is at least as important as the message itself. The participating artists focused on questions such as: what role does light play as a medium or a message? And how can light create spaces that would otherwise have remained invisible? The city of Amsterdam as a medium for telling stories is also a central part of this edition.\nOn behalf of the festival, art historian Koen Kleijn went in search of remarkable stories about the city and from October onward they will be released as a ten-part series on the festival website. In his stories, Kleijn identifies the connection between the city and the central theme.\n\nSome of the lighting installations on show at the 7th Amsterdam Light Festival – previews\n\n7th Amsterdam Light Festival\n29 November 2018 | 20 January 2019",

        "articleBody": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday unveiled the first global geological map of Saturn's moon Titan including vast plains and dunes of frozen organic material and lakes of liquid methane, illuminating an exotic world considered a strong candidate in the search for life beyond Earth.\n\nThe map was based on radar, infrared and other data collected by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017. Titan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the Solar System's second-biggest moon behind Jupiter's Ganymede. It is larger than the planet Mercury.\n\nOrganic materials - carbon-based compounds critical for fostering living organisms - play a leading role on Titan.\n\n\"Organics are very important for the possibility of life on Titan, which many of us think likely would have evolved in the liquid water ocean under Titan's icy crust,\" said planetary geologist Rosaly Lopes of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\n\n\"Organic materials can, we think, penetrate down to the liquid water ocean and this can provide nutrients necessary for life, if it evolved there,\" added Lopes, who led the research published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nOn Earth, water rains down from clouds and fills rivers, lakes and oceans. On Titan, clouds spew hydrocarbons like methane and ethane - which are gases on Earth - in liquid form due to the moon's frigid climate.\n\nRainfall occurs everywhere on Titan, but the equatorial regions are drier than the poles, said study co-author Anezina Solomonidou, a European Space Agency research fellow.\n\nPlains (covering 65 percent of the surface) and dunes (covering 17 percent of the surface) made up of frozen bits of methane and other hydrocarbons dominate Titan's mid-latitudes and equatorial regions, respectively.\n\nTitan is the only Solar System object other than Earth boasting stable liquids on the surface, with lakes and seas of full of methane being major features at its polar regions. Hilly and mountainous areas, thought to represent exposed portions of Titan's crust of water ice, represent 14 percent of the surface.\n\n\"What is really fun to think about is if there are any ways that those more complex organics can go down and mix with water in the deep icy crust or deep subsurface ocean,\" JPL scientist and study co-author Michael Malaska said.\n\nNoting that on Earth there is a bacterium that can survive just on a hydrocarbon called acetylene and water, Malaska asked, \"Could it or something like it live in Titan deep in the crust or ocean where temperatures are a little warmer?\"\n\nThe map was created seven years before the US space agency is set to launch its Dragonfly mission to dispatch a multi-rotor drone to study Titan's chemistry and suitability for life. Dragonfly is scheduled to reach Titan in 2034.\n\n\"It is not only scientifically important but also really cool - a drone flying around on Titan,\" Lopes said. \"It will be really exciting.\"\n\n(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Tom Brown)\n\n© Reuters",

        "articleBody": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Dubai's flagship carrier Emirates Airline finalized a deal to purchase 30 of Boeing 's 787-9 Dreamliner jets, executives of both companies announced Wednesday at the Dubai Air Show.\n\nThe deal sets up for a reduction to a prior commitment of 777x jets from the U.S. plane-maker, down by 30 to 126, which Emirates is opting for by employing its substitution rights. The 777 program has faced delays due to engine problems and other technical issues in its testing phase.\n\nThe mid-size wide body 787-9 jet is a larger and longer-range variant of Boeing's Dreamliner, seating 242 to 330 passengers in a two-class layout. The order is valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines.\n\nThe order is crucial for the American manufacturing giant, whose sales have been badly hit following two catastrophic crashes of its popular 737 Max jet in less than five months that killed a total of 346 people. Its fleet of roughly 400 737 Max jets around the world have been grounded since March.\n\nIt comes in addition to five 787 Dreamliner sales earlier this week: two to Biman Bangladesh Airlines and three to the Ghanaian government ahead of its launch of a new local carrier. Boeing also managed to attract bids for some 60 of the embattled 737 Max jet from Turkish-based carrier SunExpress, Kazakhstan's Air Astana and a third undisclosed buyer.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark, meanwhile, told reporters at a press conference that the airline — the largest international carrier in the world — will recommence its expansion in the early 2020s, following its current period of consolidation. Clark in October revealed lofty plans to expand the Emirates fleet by 30% by the end of 2025.\n\nAs of October, Emirates had a fleet of 270 aircraft, including 12 freight. In addition to its order of 30 Boeing jets Wednesday, it announced an order of 50 Airbus A350-900 jets on Monday at a value of $16 billion at list prices. The A350 order had been revised to cancel a prior order of A330neo jets from the French plane-maker, favoring a larger order of the lighter and slightly wider-body A350.\n\nEmirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, with 123 of the planes in its fleet. But its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the \"end of an era,\" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners.",

        "articleBody": "A \"phase one\" trade deal between the United States and China was supposed to be a limited agreement that would allow leaders from both countries to claim an easy victory while soothing financial markets.\n\nBut it may morph into something bigger if US President Donald Trump agrees to Beijing's demands to roll back existing tariffs on Chinese goods, people familiar with the talks say.\n\nChina's commerce ministry said this month that removing tariffs imposed during the trade war is an important condition to any deal. The demand has US officials wondering if higher Chinese purchases of US farm goods, promises of improved access to China's financial services industry, and pledges to protect intellectual property are enough to ask in return.\n\nTwo people briefed on the talks said Trump has decided that rolling back existing tariffs, in addition to cancelling a scheduled Dec. 15 imposition of tariffs on some $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, requires deeper concessions from China.\n\n\"The president wants the option of having a bigger deal with China. Bigger than just the little deal\" announced in October, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nScissors, who consults with administration officials, said whether Trump will agree to remove existing tariffs depends largely on whether he believes it will benefit his re-election chances. Some White House advisers would like to see China agree to large, specific agricultural purchases, while the US maintains existing tariffs for future leverage.\n\nThat would help Trump's farm belt constituency while allowing the president to campaign on maintaining his \"tough on China\" stance, which holds appeal to voters in key states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Beijing is balking at committing to a specific amount of farm product purchases, within a particular time frame, and wants to let supply and demand dictate deals instead.\n\nBeijing also wants Trump to eliminate the 15% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods imposed on Sept. 1, as well as provide some relief from the 25% tariffs imposed on an earlier, $250 billion list of industrial and consumer goods.\n\nOne Washington-based trade expert said that to achieve the $40-50 billion in annual Chinese purchases of American farm goods touted by Trump in October, he would likely have to eliminate all of the tariffs the US put in place since the trade war started in 2018.\n\nTrump and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that making such concessions for a \"skinny\" trade deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues is not a very good deal for Trump, a second person briefed on last weekend's trade phone call said.\n\nTrump is the final decision-maker in the US on any deal, and hasn't committed to any specifics so far, White House advisers say.\n\nThe president said on Tuesday that China \"is going to have to make a deal that I like. If they don't, that's it.\"\n\nA 'phase one' trade deal, once expected to be completed within weeks of an October news conference between Trump and Chinese vice-premier Liu He, could now be pushed into next year, trade experts say.",

        "articleBody": "The formation of galaxies is a complex dance between matter and energy, occurring on a stage of cosmic proportions and spanning billions of years. How the diversity of structured and dynamic galaxies we observe today arose from the fiery chaos of the Big Bang remains one of the most difficult unsolved puzzles of cosmology.\n\nIn search of answers, an international team of scientists has created the most detailed large-scale model of the universe to date, a simulation they call TNG50. Their virtual universe, some 230 million light-years wide, contains tens of thousands of evolving galaxies with levels of detail previously seen only in single-galaxy models. The simulation tracked more than 20 billion particles representing dark matter, gases, stars and supermassive black holes, over a 13.8-billion-year period.\n\nThe unprecedented resolution and scale allowed the researchers to gather key insights into our own universe's past, revealing how various oddly shaped galaxies morphed themselves into being and how stellar explosions and black holes triggered this galactic evolution. Their results are published in two articles to be featured in the December 2019 issue of the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nTNG50 is the latest simulation created by the IllustrisTNG Project, which aims to build a complete picture of how our universe evolved since the Big Bang by producing a large-scale universe without sacrificing the fine details of individual galaxies.\n\n\"These simulations are huge datasets where we can learn a ton by dissecting and understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies within them,\" said Paul Torrey, associate professor of physics at the University of Florida and co-author of the study. \"What's fundamentally new about TNG50, is that you're getting to a sufficiently high mass and spatial resolution within the galaxies that give you a clear picture of what the internal structure of the systems looks like as they form and evolve.\"\n\nThe model's attention to detail comes at some cost. The simulation required 16,000 processor cores of the Hazel Hen supercomputer in Stuttgart, Germany, running continuously for more than a year. The same calculation would take a single processor system 15,000 years to compute. Despite being one of the most computationally heavy astrophysical simulations in history, the researchers believe their investment has paid off.\n\n\"Numerical experiments of this kind are particularly successful when you get out more than you put in,\" Dylan Nelson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany, and co-author of the study, said in a statement. \"In our simulation, we see phenomena that had not been programmed explicitly into the simulation code. These phenomena emerge in a natural fashion, from the complex interplay of the basic physical ingredients of our model universe.\"\n\nThat emergent phenomenon might be essential to understanding why our universe appears as it is today 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. TNG50 allowed researchers to see firsthand how galaxies may have emerged from the turbulent clouds of gas present shortly after the universe was born. They discovered that the disk-shaped galaxies common to our cosmic neighborhood naturally emerged within their simulation and produced internal structures, including spiral arms, bulges and bars extending from their central supermassive black holes. When they compared their computer-generated universe to real-life observations, they found their population of galaxies were qualitatively consistent with reality.\n\nAs their galaxies continued to flatten into well-ordered rotating disks, another phenomenon began to emerge. Supernova explosions and supermassive black holes at the heart of each galaxy created high-speed outflows of gas. These outflows morphed into fountains of gas rising thousands of light-years above a galaxy. The tug of gravity eventually brought much of this gas back unto the galaxy's disk, redistributing it to its outer edge and creating a feedback loop of gas outflow and inflow. Apart from recycling the ingredients for forming new stars, the outflows were also shown to change their galaxy's structure. The recycled gases accelerated the transformation of galaxies into thin rotating disks.\n\nDespite these initial findings, the team is far from finished dissecting their model. They also plan to release all of the simulation's data publicly for astronomers across the world to study their virtual cosmos.\n\n\"There's a huge road ahead of us now that we have these simulations completed,\" Torrey said. \"A whole team of researchers are working to better understand the detailed properties of the galaxies that form and what emergent trends show up in that data.\"\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.",

        "articleBody": "Audi has revealed the second production model in its e-tron all-electric range, with the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback making its debut at the LA Auto Show. Joining the Audi e-tron SUV, the new e-tron Sportback will have Quattro electric all-wheel drive as standard and, in Europe, up to 277 miles of range. US range is yet to be tested.\n\nIt’s a handsome EV, certainly. More akin to a four-door coupe than the SUV of the original e-tron, the new Sportback is just over 16 feet long and six feet wide, but 5.3 feet high. Steeply-raked D-pillars help give it a distinctive side profile.\n\nAt the front, there’s Audi’s familiar Singleframe grille, with vertical struts in light platinum gray. It’s flanked by new digital matrix LED lights, the individual pixels of which can be more specifically controlled. That, Audi says, allows the e-tron Sportback to highlight particular features in the road – such as markings – with extra-precision.\n\nFor the rear, there’s a broad diffuser and a light strip spanning the two LED clusters. Audi will offer the car in thirteen different finishes, including a new Plasma Blue which is exclusive to the e-tron Sportback. The wheel arch trims and sills are finished in matte anthracite, as is the underbody protection, the door sills, and the diffuser; the brake calipers can be finished in high-voltage orange, to match the logo on the electric charging flap.\n\nAudi will have an S line model, which has 20-inch wheels and sport air suspension as standard. It’ll also get a more aggressively contoured bumper, and larger front air curtains. A new diffuser on the rear is fitted, and there are body-color wheel arch trims, door sills, and other exterior features. A black styling package changes the finish for the grille, side windows, and bumper.\n\nEurope will get the option of Audi’s virtual side mirrors, which replaces the standard glass mirrors with tiny cameras. That helps cut aerodynamic drag. However US versions of the EV will have the regular mirrors due to federal regulations.\n\nPower and Performance\n\nIn Europe, there’ll be two versions: the e-tron Sportback 50 quattro and the e-tron Sportback 55 quattro. They’ll have 71 kWh and 95 kWh of battery capacity, respectively, along with 230 kW and 265 kW of power.\n\nThe US, though, will only be getting the more powerful version of the EV. That promises 355 horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque, and should do 0-62 mph in 6.6 seconds. Top speed is an electronically-limited 124 mph.\n\nIt’ll feature a boost mode, activated when the driver shifts to “S” and stomps on the accelerator. That cranks out 300 kW (402 hp) and almost 490 lb-ft of torque, lasting for eight seconds. It’s enough to cut the 0-62 mph time to 5.7 seconds.\n\nQuattro is standard, and there’s five-link suspension and electrohydraulic brakes. Up to 22-inch tires will be available, and Audi drive select – with seven different drive modes – will be standard. Adaptive air suspension can lower the e-tron Sportback at higher speeds, with the car able to adjust its height by a total of 3-inches.\n\nRange and Charging\n\nThe e-tron Sportback 50 should deliver around 215 miles on a charge, while the e-tron Sportback 55 is rated for up to 277 miles. It’s worth noting, though, that those figures are on the European WLTP cycle, which is typically more generous than the US EPA test. Euro testing was also done with the virtual side mirrors, whereas the US car will come with standard side mirrors.\n\nStill, there’ll be 150 kW DC fast charging support, with Audi suggesting that the Sportback 55 should be able to top up to 80-percent in under thirty minutes. The Sportback 50 has 120 kW charging.\n\nFor Level 2 stations, there’ll be 11 kW onboard charging as standard, and a 22 kW second on-board charging device as an option in summer 2020. Plug & Charge – which allows the car to authenticate payment with a charger simply by plugging it in – will also be enabled in 2020.\n\nInterior and Technology\n\nInside, Audi is promising space for five, and only a 0.8-inch cut in headroom versus the e-tron SUV. With the 2.1 cu.ft. front trunk, or “frunk,” you’re looking at 21.7 cu.ft. in total. Drop the rear seats and that increases to 58.4 cu.ft. A power tailgate is standard.\n\nAs with the interior of the e-tron SUV, the e-tron Sportback has both the Audi virtual cockpit and the automaker’s twin-touchscreen infotainment system. There’ll be the choice of standard, sport, S sport, and contour seats, with optional ventilation and massage. Orange contrast stitching will be an option, as will be the contour/ambient lighting package.\n\nA Bang & Olufsen Premium 3D Sound System will be available, as is Audi’s phone box which includes signal boosting and wireless charging. The 12.1-inch upper touchscreen handles e-tron settings, navigation, and multimedia, while the 8.6-inch lower display is focused on HVAC and text entry. A head-up display is optional.\n\nNatural language control is supported, with local- and cloud-based processing, while navigation is also standard. In Europe, there’ll be integrated Amazon Alexa support, too. A smartphone app will support cabin preconditioning, remote charging control, and other features; it’ll also be used to control a new “functions on demand” system which allows lighting, driver assist, and infotainment to be selectively activated on a monthly, annual, or permanent basis.\n\nAudi pre sense basic and Audi pre sense front safety are standard. The Audi assist package City with intersection assistance and rear cross traffic assistance is optional, as is the assist package Tour for adaptive cruise, turn assistance, collision avoidance assistance, and other features. Audi park assist, night vision assist, and a 360-degree camera are all available. Audi fits the car with up to five radar sensors, five cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors to feed its systems.\n\nIn Europe, where the order books open from the end of November, Audi will kick things off with the e-tron Sportback “edition one”: it’ll be a special launch edition in Plasma Blue. Regular European pricing will start at 71,350 euro ($78,770) with deliveries from spring 2020.\n\nUS pricing has not been confirmed at this stage, but the 2020 Audi e-tron Sportback is expected to go on sale in North American midway through next year.\n\nStory Timeline\n\nAudi e-tron GT Concept First Drive: Welcome to the future\n2019 Audi e-tron Review: Grading on a Curve",

        "articleBody": "Crossovers may have become the vehicle of choice for most car buyers, but that doesn't mean the sedan is no longer relevant. In fact, Nissan still believes in sedans for their practicality, space, as well as looks.\n\nAfter debuting the all-new Juke two months ago, Nissan has taken the covers off the eighth-generation Sentra. Featuring a new head-turning design that is paired to a more luxurious-looking cabin, the compact four-door has been redesigned from the ground-up and is more vibrant than ever.\n\n\"Nissan has a vibrant portfolio of new-generation sedans for customers in the U.S. Market. With more than 6 million Sentra vehicles sold, we believe the all-new Sentra will reach new heights offering refinement and quality, technology and performance not seen before. The lower stance and more athletic design cues from the Maxima sports sedan give Sentra a sexy new look,” said David Kershaw, division vice president, Nissan Sales & Regional Operations at Nissan North America Inc.\n\nTaking on a sleeker appearance, the 2020 Sentra gets a new V-Motion front grill that is complemented by a pair of eye-catching LED headlights. It also has a more sculpted hood which further accentuates the Sentra's sportier design. Wraparound taillights, meanwhile, give the sedan a sophisticated finish and are of the LED kind as well. A blacked roof along with five-spoke alloy wheels provide the 2020 Sentra an unmistakable look.\n\nInside, the Sentra's interior has been refined and is covered in high quality materials. The seats, the dashboard panel, as well as the steering wheel are all wrapped in fine leather. It also has contrast stitching which spruces up the overall look of the cabin. To improve riding comfort for the driver and front passenger, it has Nissan's NASA-inspired Zero Gravity Seats and come with a heated function.\n\nIn-car infotainment comes courtesy of an 8-inch touchscreen display. It comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as Nissan Connect. It also doubles as a display for the Intelligent Around View Monitor which allows for safer parking / maneuvering.\n\nAn all-new 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder engine replaces the previous 1.8-liter from before. It puts out 151 PS along with 197 Nm of torque; which Nissan claims is a 20% and 16% improvement respectively compared to the older engine. Besides having more oomph, Nissan said that the new 2.0-liter will deliver better fuel efficiency.\n\nA bevy of active and passive safety features are available on the 2020 Sentra. These include 10 airbags, rear door alert, intelligent forward collision warning, as well as intelligent driver awareness. Aside from those, driver assist systems such as automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, rear automatic braking, and high beam assist are also available on the 2020 Sentra.\n\nThe all-new sedan is set to go on sale in the US in late January. As to when will this arrive in the Philippines, we're not entirely sure yet but it could make its ASEAN debut at the 2020 Bangkok International Motor Show. But will we still call it the Sylphy once it arrives here? Let's wait and see.",

        "articleBody": "The bizarre odyssey of how Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen came to co-write the euphoric power-ballad that Jessie Buckley performs at the end of “ Wild Rose ” — easily the year’s best original movie song — began 10 years ago, when the “Melvin and Howard” star woke up after a minor arm surgery feeling like her mind was on fire.\n\n“I felt strange as soon as the anesthesia started to wear off,” Steenburgen said. “The best way I can describe it is that it just felt like my brain was only music, and that everything anybody said to me became musical. All of my thoughts became musical. Every street sign became musical. I couldn’t get my mind into any other mode.”\n\nFun as that might sound in an Oliver Sacks kind of way — the late neurologist wrote about similar, potentially stroke-inspired symptoms in his book “Musicophilia” — Steenburgen wasn’t thrilled about the sudden mental shift. The next two months were tough. “I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t have acted,” she said. “I couldn’t have learned any lines. My husband [actor Ted Danson] and I were kind of frightened about it.”\n\nSteenburgen’s son, filmmaker Charlie McDowell (“The Discovery,” “The One I Love”), also remembers it as a trying time. “If your mom comes to you after surgery and says that her head is now full of music, I think it’s totally fair to think that she’s gone crazy and has major psychological problems,” he said. “All of a sudden she was referencing these obscure indie bands and picking up random instruments — I’m not gonna lie, the accordion playing drives me nuts,” McDowell laughed. “When I say all this out loud it sounds insane. It was definitely a change.”\n\nDespite the paucity of roles for women in their mid-50s, the actress wasn’t exactly itching to do something else. “I had been somebody who really liked music,” she said, “but I had never been obsessed with it; I was obsessed with acting, and that felt like a big enough subject for me.”\n\nWhen the music didn’t go away, Steenburgen realized that she had to do something with it — if only for her sanity — even though she didn’t know how to play an instrument. “I called a very talented friend of mine on Martha’s Vineyard and I said: ‘Look, if I come over every day and sing what I hear in my head, could you help me make them into songs?’” she said. She wrote hundreds of songs that summer and sent 12 of the best ones to a music lawyer under her mother’s name. “He wanted to work with ‘Nellie Wall,’ but then I showed up instead,” she said.\n\nThe next thing she knew, Steenburgen had been signed to Universal as a songwriter and was on a plane to Nashville. It was the first stride on a strange path that would eventually lead to Tom Harper and Jessie Buckley’s doorstep almost a decade later.\n\nFlash-forward to 2017, when Harper — a young British filmmaker hot off directing a lush BBC adaptation of “War & Peace” — had just found his next project. He’d fallen in love with an electric Nicole Taylor script called “Wild Rose,” a fish-out-of-water story about a self-destructive Glaswegian country singer and single mom whose only dream in life is to sing Patsy Cline ballads at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry. Buckley — who landed a key role in “War & Peace” after surging to fame on the U.K. singing competition “I’d Do Anything” — had agreed to play Rose-Lynn Harlan, and Harper knew in his bones that she was perfect for the part.\n\nThere was just one problem: The climactic song that ties the whole movie together didn’t exist. The script called for a soaring, original anthem that Rose-Lynn belts to a loving hometown crowd in the very last scene after she’s learned to reconcile her dreams with her reality in a way that makes them both feel a little more special, but no details. Phoning in from London, Harper remembered the anxiety of moving forward without that crucial missing piece: “The script just said something along the lines of, ‘Rose-Lynn sings an incredible song and it conveys everything that she wants to express to her mom and kids and everyone’s uplifted. The end,’” Harper said. “I had faith that we could figure it out, but it was really worrying.” Universal’s music division provided some demos, but none of them clicked.\n\nAt the last minute, a sample came in called “Glasgow (“No Place Like Home”). “It grabbed me by the heart the moment I heard it,” he said. “It just connected.” Buckley, who phoned in from the Chicago set of “Fargo,” had a similar experience: “It was just that immediate feeling of ‘ this is the song.’”\n\nThat’s when Harper and Buckley first learned who had written it, and found themselves blindsided by “the Mary Steenburgen of it all.”\n\nAs it turned out, Steenburgen had spent the last few years toiling away on her own dream of making it in Music City. And despite the many advantages that her fame might have afforded her, she was more nervous about going there than Rose-Lynn Harlan has ever been about anything. “It was terrifying,” she said. “The first session I did was a total disaster, and I literally went back to my hotel room in tears, cried my eyes out, and thought ‘Why would anyone be so stupid at age 54 to think they could do something so new?’”\n\nBut she also felt like she didn’t have much of a choice. “I was back at it by the next morning,” she said. “I just told myself: ‘I’m going to go right up and sing the bleeping song if it kills me!’” Not long after that, Steenburgen bought a house in Nashville.\n\nMcDowell still laughs at the memory of hearing his mom spontaneously begin to scat in the backseat of his car. “It could have been really easy for Mary Steenburgen to just put her name on something and get a pass on many of the usual steps in some new creative thing, but she didn’t do that,” she said. “She put in the time to learn the craft, and I respect that. And I have to admit, she’s gotten really good at the accordion.”\n\nSteenburgen’s career experience also gave her a unique advantage over the competition: While most of the songwriters who submitted demos for “Wild Rose” were content to read a plot synopsis and work in broad strokes from there, Steenburgen approached the assignment as if the song were a character for her to play. “I fought to get the full script, because I just felt like I was looking at such a small part of the story without it,” she said. “Where does Rose-Lynn live? What does her apartment look like? I needed to think of imagery that might be cohesive with what the production designer, the cinematographer, and the composer would be doing; there are all these people you haven’t met yet who are telling the same story. And as soon as I read the whole thing, I understood what we were writing.”\n\nThat process led to a realization: “It was a really love song from Rose-Lynn to her mother …It was also a love song to her city and a love song to the concept of home and the fact that home doesn’t have to be second best for her or something that she settles for.”\n\nBoth accomplished songwriters who had previously written music for the television show “Nashville,” Steenburgen’s co-writers Caitlyn Smith and Kate York came to the project with a similar appreciation for the challenge of writing character-driven chords. “It’s a totally different muscle,” York said. “You have to take yourself out of it a little bit — it’s kind of like acting, I guess.” Smith agreed: “It’s a different job altogether. If you’re just writing a song for someone else, it’s wide open and sometimes hard to figure out. And if you’re writing for yourself, you’re really digging into your own heart.” This particular task was a little bit of both. “I feel like we could get into the guts of this song because we’ve all lived a similar crazy dream story,” Smith said.\n\nThe first thing they found out is that Rose-Lynn worships Patsy Cline, and so the three writers knew they had to craft something with classic country DNA (not an obvious assumption in a film that builds to a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo from a genre-bending superstar like Kacey Musgraves). Smith seized on something with a 6/8 feel, and they all decided to stay there. But the songwriters also reckoned with the role that Glasgow plays in Rose-Lynn’s life, and not just as an albatross around her neck.\n\n“Anything we wrote had to have a fond hint of Scotland,” Steenburgen said. “So I called one of my best friends, a Scottish woman who started out as a nanny and ended up like a sister,” a detail that dovetails eerily well with the plot of the film. “So I called her up and said ‘Talk to me in your accent — talk to me about you.’ And through that we wound up with images like the opening line: ‘I’ve worn out the stones in front of your doorstep.’”\n\nThe entire song went from a dream to a demo in just a few short hours — which, when you listen to “Glasgow,” seems as crazy as the story that led Steenburgen to co-write it. “It may sound shallow or like it’s a factory when I talk about how fast we write these things,” Steenburgen said, “but I always think of it like this: ‘I can’t take days to do a scene.’ I can’t say ‘I don’t know what the emotion is for the character, so can you give me until tomorrow?’ I’m always having to tell stories on a time limit.” Steenburgen has only found one drawback to collaborating with Smith and York: “They’re such good singers that people are going to get intimidated by their demos and go, ‘Well I can’t sing like that, so I’m not doing that song.’”\n\n“Wild Rose”\n\n1996-98 AccuSoft Inc., All right\n\nBuckley, who hadn’t sung in a long time before the production, worried about doing justice to a song like “Glasgow,” especially given that she had no background in country music. “But the story of it really moved me,” she said, “so I sat down with a guitarist in a room and sang it really badly and just tried to attach some emotional feeling to it before we started filming.”\n\nBy the time Buckley learned who had written the song, she was only half-surprised: “It made sense, because it clearly came from someone with a complex understanding of character — someone who was able to kind of go right to the root of what this woman’s story is about, and managed to write lyrics that exposed the cracks under the surface,” she said.\n\nWhile Buckley own story feels something like a fairy tale come true, she drew a distinction with her character. “I told her my secrets and she told me hers and we built a different person together,” she said. “‘Glasgow’ is a song of belonging. It’s about stretching yourself to places that you don’t know are within yourself.” For the first time in a long time, Buckley had something to sing about. “This song was such a gift to me,” she said. In turn, it also became her gift to the women who wrote it.\n\nSteenburgen called Buckley’s performance “stunning,” but seemed changed by the experience in a fundamentally different way than everyone else involved. “Music is in my genes thanks to the women in my family, and I just think I was somehow granted access to it,” she said. “It was so overwhelming for me in the beginning because I didn’t grow up with having that voice in my head, like Kate and Caitlyn did.”\n\nThe barnstormer of a song that Rose-Lynn performs in the film’s last scene conveys the ache and discovery of her journey from prison to paradise. It begins with Buckley’s voice cresting through an ocean of silence, as Rose-Lynn summons the strength to confront her regrets until they resolve into love. She apologizes to her family, her children, and the entire life she tried to escape: “I pushed you away, put a pin in a map, then I got lost in the storm.”\n\nA faint lilt begins to hum behind her, peeking through the lyrics like the first ray of sunshine after a squall: It’s an accordion, lighting Rose-Lynn’s way towards a place she never could have imagined before. “Had to find my own way, make my own mistakes, but you know that I had to go,” she sings. “Ain’t no yellow brick road running through Glasgow, but I found one that’s stronger than stone.”\n\nAnd then Rose-Lynn hits the chorus with the sweet relief of someone who’s tunneled their way to freedom, as Buckley’s voice swells from low to high and back again. She sings on behalf of anyone who’s ever had to learn about themselves the hard way: “Ain’t no place like home,” she and Rose-Lynn sing together, and as the song becomes so big that it envelopes them both, along with all the Glaswegian extras who packed into Celtic Connections for the 12-hour shoot, and everyone in the audience. It’s staggering.\n\nIt’s also not the happy ending that Rose-Lynn imagined for herself. And yet, happiness often looks different from how you saw it in your head. When Steenburgen’s life took an unexpected detour, it felt like fate (or a weird quirk of anatomy) was forcing her to choose between the dream she’d had since she was just a starry-eyed girl in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the strange new reality that had ambushed her in a hospital one night. To hear it from her now, it sounds like she’s found a beautiful harmony between the two.\n\n“I didn’t fall out of love with acting when this happened,” Steenburgen said, “and I still haven’t. But there’s so much more capability in our brains than we probably realize, and agreeing to diminishment and shutting down doors is a choice that we all make for ourselves. It turns out you don’t really have to do that.”\n\n“Wild Rose” is now available on DVD and VOD.",

On it!\n\nOf course, you might just be able to see the issue here, besides the fact that Florida Man will have to up the ante next time.\n\nAnd if you haven’t yet noticed what might be wrong, a whole lot of people on Twitter pointed it out.\n\nYes this is real and yes the state spent nearly half a million dollars on it: https://t.co/Nc0nKoXGBP\n\n— Dianna E. Anderson 🏳️‍🌈 (@diannaeanderson) November 18, 2019\n\nSo many people were talking about South Dakota’s odd new slogan that the state and “We’re On It\" became top Twitter trends.\n\nAccording to a report in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, Gov. Kristi Noem launched the campaign on Monday in an effort to address the state’s meth crisis.\n\n“Meth. We’re on it” is rolling out with TV commercials and billboards in which people say, “I’m on meth.”\n\nThe report says the Minneapolis ad agency Broadhead Co. came up with the campaign, and the state has paid the agency nearly $449,000 so far this year.\n\nOh, no. It seems like the rest of South Dakota's anti-drug campaigns are just as bad as the \"Meth. We're On It.\" campaign. pic.twitter.com/3BDnrvkoms\n\n— Mike Beauvais (@MikeBeauvais) November 18, 2019\n\non. meth. dot. com.\nmeth.\nwe’re. on. it. https://t.co/HO1ZRs9T1P\n\n— tall glass of coquito 🎄 (@_orabora) November 19, 2019\n\nNoem saw the Twitter reaction and ... doubled down on the slogan.\n\n“Hey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness,” Noem tweeted. “So I think that’s working.”\n\nShe proceeded to share the hashtag #MethWeAreOnIt and onmeth.com, the website for the initiative, which contains the following statement:\n\n“South Dakota has a problem. There isn’t a single solution because meth is widespread. But we can approach it from different angles, so it doesn’t take over counties, towns, neighborhoods. Let’s work together. Meth. We’re on it.”\n\nHey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness. So I think that’s working... #thanks #MethWeAreOnIt\n⬇️⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/hopPjqa95w\n\n— Governor Kristi Noem (@govkristinoem) November 18, 2019\n\nStill, this isn’t the first time a slogan has gone awry in South Dakota.\n\nConsider this 2014 entry — “ Don’t jerk and drive,\" meant to discourage drivers from jerking the wheels of their cars while traveling on icy roads.\n\nThe road safety slogan was an intentional play for a double entendre, but drew enough criticism to get the ax from the state Department of Public Safety.\n\nWhile we focus on South Dakota’s “Meth. We’re on it.” ad campaign, we should not forget the state’s failed “Don’t Jerk and Drive” campaign from 2014. https://t.co/hFciHO5Qc7 pic.twitter.com/KQLpngeTbO\n\n— Cooper Lund (@cooperlund) November 18, 2019",

        "articleBody": "This holiday season I was thinking of flavors that would put me in the holiday spirit when it came to me. Not to be confused with a 1990s grunge band, pear jam is a delicious gift to give for the holidays. With notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove, this honey pear jam recipe will have you spreading Yuletide cheer in no time! It’s so easy and delicious that you’ll want to make some extra for yourself!\n\nIs there anything better than a piece of toast or a biscuit topped with a dollop of jam? Especially homemade jam. Not many things are more homey and comforting than jam that has been made in someone’s kitchen. Up until not too long ago, I used to think that people who made their own jam must be wizards. Jam has always seemed like one of those things that only other people made, and then I tried it. Honestly, it’s so easy that anyone can do it with a few simple ingredients and not much equipment.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE JAM\n\nDo you make jam in a pot? A pressure canner? I don’t know. Help!\n\nThe simple answer is that foods with low acidity need to be canned in a pressure canner. For this jam, though, all you need is an inexpensive water bath canner with a rack. A water bath canner is really just a big porcelain stockpot that will hold about ten canning jars depending on their size. They also come with a rack that makes removing your jars easier and keeps them from coming in contact with the bottom of the canner.\n\nIn addition to the canner pot, you will need some mason jars (I prefer 8-ounce jelly jars), a ladle, and something to remove the hot jars from boiling water. You could get creative or just use a jar lifter which is a nifty set of tongs made specifically to fit over mason jars.\n\nMAKING SPICED HONEY PEAR JAM\n\nNow that you have your equipment, you will need the ingredients. About 8 ripe pears, a fresh lemon, fruit pectin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves, and a 16-ounce Don Victor® Orange Blossom Comb Honey Globe Jar. Before getting your jam mixture ready, fill your canner to the line on the inside and set it to simmer. Add your jelly jars and let them get warm while you make your jam.\n\nCube and peel the pears with a paring knife and put them in a large pot. To the pears, add the juice of one lemon and spices. Stir together and taste test it to make sure your flavors are where you want them to be before adding the fruit pectin powder. Heat to boiling for a minute or so to combine the spices and pears, then add a jar Don Victor® Honey, or about a cup and a half. Let the mixture boil until thickened on the back of a spoon, or about 5-8 minutes.\n\nHOW TO USE A WATER BATH CANNER\n\nWhen your jam mixture is the correct consistency, use a ladle to transfer the mixture into the warm and sterilized jelly jars. I may or may not have been going a little too fast and spilled some hot jam on my hand. I don’t recommend that, so please pour slowly and carefully.\n\nNow that your jars are filled, put the tops on, lower the rack into the canner, and use your jar lifter to lower the jars into the water one at a time. Turn the stove up from simmering to boil the jars for *10 minutes. If you live at an altitude of more than 1000 feet as I do, you will need to adjust your boiling time. There are altitude charts available online. We are at 5280 feet in Denver so I boiled mine for 20 minutes.\n\nRemove the jars from the boiling water and let them cool for several hours. If your jam looks runny, don’t worry. It will thicken as it cools. It could take 24-48 hours to really look like jam.\n\nGIVING THE GIFT OF HOMEMADE JAM\n\nIf you choose to gift your honey pear jam to friends and family, there are so many ways you can present your gift. Make cute labels, put it in a gift basket, or add a piece of fabric and a ribbon to dress up the jar and pass them out to your friends and family. No matter how you choose to present your gift, it’s sure to be a winner.\n\nDecorating the top of your jelly jars with fabric is super simple. Cut a piece of fabric in a circle to use as a cover for your jelly jars and fasten with a ribbon to make them extra festive. Set them aside in a pretty basket if you wish, ready to hand out to your friends, family, and coworkers.\n\nUSING HONEY INSTEAD OF SUGAR\n\nI like to use honey because it has more flavor than sugar. In general, when substituting honey for sugar in a recipe you will use about half the amount. For instance, the original recipe for this jam called for three cups of sugar, but I only use a cup and a half of honey.\n\nBoth the pear jam and honey are a delicious addition to toast, biscuits, or homemade vanilla scones.\n\nSpiced Honey Pear Jam\n\nIngredients\n\n8-9 ripe pears, cored and peeled\n1 lemon, or about 1/4 cup lemon juice\n6 tbsp fruit pectin powder\n1 tsp cinnamon\n1 tsp nutmeg\n1 tsp ground ginger\n1/2 tsp ground cloves\n1 jar Don Victor® Honey, or 1 1/2 cups\n\nInstructions\n\nFill canner with water and set it to simmer. Add empty jelly jars to sterilize and warm.\nCore, peel, and cube the pears and put them in a pot. Add the juice of one lemon, spices, and fruit pectin. Boil while stirring frequently for about a minute\nAdd 1 1/2 cups Don Victor® Honey and boil until thickened enough to stick to the spoon.\nSpoon jam mixture into jelly jars, put the top on, and put them in a water bath canner, increasing the heat to a easy boil.\nBoil for *10 minutes (if over 1000 feet, adjust for altitude)\nRemove from canner and allow to cool. Jam will set within 24-48 hours.\n\n© Regan",

        "articleBody": "Washington, DC, United States: Getting to the Moon, while not easy, has been done. Staying on the Moon and reaching Mars, however, haven’t. Why? Because space travel and sustaining life off Earth are anything but easy.\n\nIt is for that reason that the United States's space agency NASA on Monday enlisted the engineering muscle of what are arguably the commercial space industry’s upstarts - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX among them - to prepare the ground for its planned 2024 crewed moon shot.\n\n“We have a need and saw a need to bring on some additional providers that had enhanced lander capabilities,” Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a conference call with media.\n\n“This is based on our objectives, the agency’s objectives, to get to the moon as soon as possible, both from a scientific standpoint and from a human exploration standpoint,” he said.\n\nA year ago, NASA announced that nine US companies were eligible to bid for contracts to regularly launch spacecraft carrying instruments and experiments, and to land that cargo on the moon as early as next year. But in May, when the space agency tapped three of those companies to send robotic landers next year, only two committed to that timeline.\n\nThe importance of deadlines intensified last week as NASA’s Office of the Inspector General released two highly critical reports that depicted “technical challenges, cost increases and schedule delays ”. The report and Monday’s announcement come as US lawmakers are debating the agency’s 2020 budget request for $22.6bn, and whether a crewed 2024 moon mission is even feasible.\n\nIn May, NASA’s Administrator Jim Bridenstine said returning to the moon was necessary to build the infrastructure and knowledge base to send astronauts to Mars. Today that mission scope may well have expand ed to Jupiter’s moon Europa, as NASA’s scientists have confirmed that they have detected water vapour above that moon’s icy crust.\n\nNASA believes this discovery is further evidence that the essential ingredients for life - chemical elements, sources of energy and liquid water - are on Europa.\n\nCloser to home, NASA’s Monday announcement to expand by five the pool of eligible bidders for taking payloads to and from the Earth’s moon, increased the total of commercial providers to 14. A few of the new additions - Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation and SpaceX - are notable for not having been on last year’s original list.\n\n“We’re honoured to join this community of 14 providers, diverse providers that are taking us back to the moon. And we are going,” said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs at Blue Origin. “It’s very exciting times. We’re using our Blue Moon lander, which is [a] big one.”\n\nWhile payloads bring to mind images of cargo, the companies said they wanted to expand their services to include passengers.\n\nRounding out the five awardees, NASA also chose to receive bids from two relatively smaller organisations, Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc, for indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity services with a combined maximum value of $2.6bn over the next decade.\n\n“Space exploration, and especially humans becoming multi-planetary, requires an entire ecosystem to do what has to be done,” said Michael Sims, CEO and Founder of Ceres Robotics Inc.\n\n“There are the big established players, as for example around the table SpaceX and Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada and Tyvak, but there are also small players. And we are one of those. The small players bring an agility and creativity that adds to the mix.”",

        "articleBody": "LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO\n\nBrace yourself, Swifties: Taylor Swift might not be able to perform all of her hits due to a legal dispute with Scooter Braun (which owns her former record label, Big Machine) ... and private equity giant The Carlyle Group. Wait, what?\n\nThe drama began earlier this year when Braun’s Ithaca Holdings purchased Big Machine for $300M in a deal backed by The Carlyle Group. Carlyle, which already held a stake in Ithaca, is part of a growing number of PE shops getting involved in the music industry.\n\nWhy? Because, capitalism, of course. You see, owning music catalogs has become an incredibly lucrative business with the rise in streaming services. *Sharks begin circling*\n\nBack to Taylor! It’s her music, so why can’t she sing it?\n\nIt’s complicated.\n\nAccording to Swift, her former label Big Machine, which owns her masters (aka original recordings), is preventing her from performing her past hits at the American Music Awards and for an upcoming Netflix special.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's not uncommon for artists to give up the rights to their original recordings. What isn't as common is a label not allowing an artist to perform their music. Mostly because performing the bangers (in Swift's case ... most of her music) benefits the owner and the artist financially.\n\nHe said, she said\n\nT-Swift took to Twitter to air her grievances with Big Machine, Braun and The Carlyle Group (what a time to be alive), recruiting fans to join her cause ... because hell hath no fury like a teenaged fangirl scorned. Big Machine has denied Swift’s claims, saying they were “shocking and false.” And Taylor Swift fans almost broke Investopedia trying to figure out WTF private equity is.\n\nThe bottom line ...\n\nTaylor Swift is ready to take her songs back and has indicated that she’ll be re-recording her biggest hits. Yep, that's kosher. Which versions play on the radio and streaming services will determine how big of a blow will be dealt to Big Machine and The Carlyle Group.\n\nMoving forward, Swift has a new record deal in place with Universal Music Group, and The Carlyle Group will be left to wonder: \"what did we do to deserve this?\"\n\nWhy Can’t Taylor Swift Perform Her Own Songs?

        "articleBody": "In July 2018, we recommended a $5.1 million grant to Evidence Action Beta to create a program dedicated to developing potential GiveWell top charities by prototyping, testing, and scaling programs which have the potential to be highly impactful and cost-effective.\n\nThis grant was made as part of GiveWell’s Incubation Grants program, which aims to support potential future GiveWell top charities and to help grow the pipeline of organizations we can consider for a recommendation. Funding for Incubation Grants comes from Good Ventures, a large foundation with which we work closely.\n\nSummary\n\nThis post will discuss the following:\n\nWhy Evidence Action Beta is promising. (More)\nRisks we see with this Incubation Grant. (More)\nOur plans for following Evidence Action Beta’s work going forward. (More)\n\nIncubation Grant to Evidence Action Beta\n\nWe summarized our case for making this grant in a recently-published write-up:\n\nA key part of GiveWell’s research process is trying to identify evidence-backed, cost-effective programs. GiveWell sometimes finds programs that seem potentially highly impactful based on academic research, but for which there is no obvious organizational partner that could scale up and test them. This grant will fund Evidence Action Beta to create … [an] incubator … focused on interventions that GiveWell and Evidence Action believe are promising but that lack existing organizations to scale them.\n\nWe have found that which program a charity works on is generally the most important factor in determining its overall cost-effectiveness. Through partnering with Evidence Action Beta to test programs that we think have the potential to be very cost-effective, … our hope is that programs tested and scaled up through this partnership may eventually become GiveWell top charities.\n\nWe believe this incubator has the potential to fill a major gap in the nonprofit world by providing a well-defined path for testing and potentially scaling … promising idea[s] for helping the global poor.\n\nFor full details on the grant activities and budget, see this page.\n\nWe believe that Evidence Action Beta is well-positioned to run this incubator because of its track record of scaling up cost-effective programs with high-quality monitoring. Evidence Action Beta’s parent organization, Evidence Action, leads two of our top charities (Deworm the World Initiative and No Lean Season) and one standout charity (Dispensers for Safe Water).\n\nModeling cost-effectiveness\n\nIn addition to the theoretical case for the grant outlined above, we also made explicit predictions and modeled the potential cost-effectiveness of this grant, so we could better consider it relative to other options. In this section, we provide more details on our process for estimating the grant’s cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe main path to impact we see with this grant is by creating new top charities which could use GiveWell-directed funds more cost-effectively than alternatives could.\n\nThis could occur:\n\nif Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are more cost-effective than our current top charities, or\nif Evidence Action Beta incubates charities which are similarly cost-effective to our current top charities—in a scenario in which we have mostly filled our current top charities’ funding gaps. Right now, we believe our top charities can absorb significantly more funding than we expect to direct to them; this diminishes our view of the value of finding additional, similarly cost-effective opportunities. If our current top charities’ funding gaps were close to filled, we would place higher value on identifying additional room for more funding at a similarly cost-effective level.\n\nThis grant could also have an impact if it causes other, non-GiveWell funders to allocate resources to charities incubated by this grant. This incubator may create programs that GiveWell doesn’t direct funding to but others do. If these new opportunities are more cost-effective than what these funders would have otherwise supported, then this grant will have had a positive impact by causing funds to be spent more cost-effectively, even if GiveWell never recommends funding to the new programs directly.\n\nWe register forecasts for all Incubation Grants we make. We register these not because we are confident in them but because they help us clarify and communicate our expectation for the outcomes of the grant. Here, we forecast a 55% chance that Evidence Action Beta’s incubator leads to a new top charity by December 2023 that is 1-2x as cost-effective as the giving opportunity to which we would have otherwise directed those funds and a 30% chance that the grant does not lead to any new top charities by that time. (For more forecasts we made surrounding this grant, see here.)\n\nWe incorporated our forecasts as well as the potential impacts outlined above in our cost-effectiveness estimate for the grant: note that the potential upside coming from other funders is a particularly rough estimate which could change substantially with additional research.\n\nOur best guess is that this grant is approximately ~9x as cost-effective as cash transfers, but we have spent limited time on this estimate and are highly uncertain about it. For context, we estimate that the average cost-effectiveness of our current top charities is between ~3x and ~12x as cost-effective as cash transfers.\n\nRisks to the success of the grant\n\nWe do see risks to the success of this grant:\n\nFew programs may be more cost-effective than our current top charities, or our top charities may remain underfunded for a long time. If Evidence Action Beta fails to identify more cost-effective giving opportunities than GiveWell’s 2017 top charities, or if it only identifies similarly cost-effective giving opportunities while our current top charities remain underfunded, barring any major upside effects, this grant will have failed to make an impact.\nWe expect this partnership with Evidence Action Beta to require a fair amount of senior staff capacity. If other means of identifying cost-effective giving opportunities, such as our work to evaluate policy opportunities, end up seeming more promising, this capacity may have been misused.\n\nGoing forward\n\nThis grant initiates a partnership with Evidence Action Beta toward which we might contribute substantial additional GiveWell Incubation Grant funding in the future. We plan to spend a fair amount of staff time on this ongoing partnership and follow this work closely.\n\nWe look forward to sharing updates and the results.",

        "articleBody": "South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) has unveiled a plan to help the PV industry further reduce the costs of solar module technology and to increase product efficiency.\n\nThe initiative is part of the Fourth Energy Technology Development Plan and Roadmap, submitted to Korean renewable energy industry representatives this week. The plan includes actions to raise electromobility rates, reduce coal-fired fine dusts by 90%, improve nuclear safety and increase the scale of wind power projects, among other measures.\n\nSixteen energy technology priorities identified by MOTIE in the roadmap include a reduction in solar module costs from around $0.23/W today to $0.10 by 2030, helped by unspecified research and development investment. As a way of rough comparison, the SunShot Initiative launched by the U.S. government in 2011 aims to reduce the price of the solar electricity generated by large scale projects to $0.03/kWh by 2030. In September 2017, the Department of Energy announced the $0.06/kWh benchmark of that ambition had been achieved three years early.\n\nModule efficiency\n\nThe South Korean government also wants to help manufacturers increase solar module efficiency from around 20% now to 24% by the end of the next decade. Seoul expects PV cell producers to increase the average efficiency of multi-junction devices from 23% to 35%.\n\nNo details were provided on how the industrial and technological targets would be achieved.\n\nThe plan appears consistent with another announced by MOTIE in March, which aimed to introduce carbon footprint certification rules, minimum efficiency levels and industrial standards for solar and wind power. Those planned guidelines are yet to see the light of day.\n\nDomestic industry\n\nA recent report by the International Energy Agency’s Photovoltaic Power Systems Program stated the South Korean solar module industry had an annual production capacity of around 8.69 GW at the end of 2017. Hanwha Q Cells had 3.7 GW of cell capacity and the same volume of module operations at that point and LG Electronics had 3 GW of output, also evenly split between cells and modules. A further 17 manufacturers, according to the report, had production operations ranging from 30-600 MW.\n\nHowever, the reduction in demand seen after Beijing attempted to rein in public solar subsidies at the end of May last year ensures some of that 8.69 GW of Korean production lines may have since been idled or closed altogether.\n\nSouth Korea also hosts several polysilicon manufacturers, including the OCI Group and Hanwha Q Cells parent Hanwha Group. That industry too is suffering from oversupply and anti-dumping duties on polysilicon imports by the Chinese government since July 2013.\n\nDespite the manufacturing setbacks introduced by its regional neighbor and solar giant, South Korea is seeing stronger than ever solar project deployment. According to data released by MOTIE in August, newly installed capacity for the first seven months of the year reached 1.64 GW and Seoul plans to install 30.8 GW of solar by 2030. That ambitious target is expected to be achieved with giant solar parks such as a recently announced 2.1 GW floating solar project and a 3 GW ground-mounted PV array planned in the Saemangeum area and announced by president Moon Jae-in a year ago.",

        "articleBody": "Breaking with decades of United States policy favoring free trade, President Donald Trump has pursued an agenda favoring tariffs as weapons in a widening trade war.\n\n\"We talk about it all the time, but under this administration, the great betrayal is over,\" Trump said at a rally in Monroe, La., on Nov. 6, 2019. \"America is no longer for sale. Thanks to my tariffs, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\"\n\nBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly.\n\nTariffs have also strengthened the United States’ leverage after massive job losses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of Trump’s tariff decisions.\n\nMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary victims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while tariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy.\n\n\"As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\" said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. \"Tariffs, like any tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the trading relationship poorer — not richer.\"\n\nStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger fraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do.\n\nThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the United States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the world.\n\nWho pays the cost of a tariff?\n\nWhen the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn’t foreign exporters that make the payment. The importers do, and they’re usually U.S. companies.\n\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer — say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written. \"The Chinese government pays nothing.\"\n\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don’t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill.\n\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are high enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It’s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality.\n\nDon’t tariffs produce revenue?\n\nRevenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through June 30, 2019.\n\nThat’s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs. For context, that’s less than 2% of annual federal revenues.\n\nMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two years.\n\nHow big an impact have the Trump tariffs had overall?\n\nAs we’ve noted, a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods, \"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\n\nSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era tariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by 2020. If that holds up, that would work out to a $75.3 billion dollar hit on economic growth, said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who studies U.S.-Canada trade.\n\nOther estimates are in the same ballpark. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump administration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while lowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent jobs.\n\nWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too. Facing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer Chinese goods, thereby hurting China’s gross domestic product.\n\nWhat tariffs has the United States imposed?\n\nIt started with washing machines and solar panels in February 2018, followed by steel and aluminum in March 2018.\n\nChina-specific tariffs took effect in July 2018, primarily covering machinery, followed by additional tariffs on China in August 2018 that covered plastics, more machinery, and electrical equipment.\n\nThe first big expansion into consumer goods from China came in September 2018, affecting home goods, electronics, furniture, backpacks, and other goods. Tariffs on Chinese goods were increased from 10% to 25% in May 2019, and the list of impacted goods expanded in September 2019 to cover some clothes, shoes, televisions and Bluetooth devices.\n\nTariffs have also been imposed on imports from the European Union, including many food products.\n\n\"The overall impact is now over $4 billion per month in extra tariffs on a wide range of goods,\" said Daniel Anthony, vice president of the Trade Partnership, a trade-focused consulting firm in Washington.\n\nWhat are the major products or sectors that have suffered negative impacts from tariffs?\n\nRetaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers.\n\nU.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. (Bad weather and other factors may have had an impact as well.)\n\nIn the meantime, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs.\n\nComputers and electronic devices have seen impacts, too, said Mary E. Lovely, a Syracuse University economist. \"About 36% of imports from China to the U.S. are computers and electronic devices,\" she said.\n\nAnd U.S. imports of \"intermediate goods\" from China, such as motors, pumps, and semiconductors, have seen price increases, harming U.S. producers. \"When the price of these inputs go up, U.S. businesses find it harder to compete against non-U.S. competitors, even in the U.S. market,\" Lovely said.",

        "articleBody": "A soothing pillow and warm duvet might not always lead to better rest. A 43-year-old-man, after having switched to feather bedding, began feeling extreme fatigue and breathlessness, and was diagnosed with \"feather-duvet lung,\" according to a new case report.\n\nThe patient went to his doctor after experiencing three months of unexplained malaise, fatigue and breathlessness. The doctor first diagnosed the man with a lower respiratory tract infection. While the man's symptoms improved a bit after that visit, they worsened later that month, forcing him to take 14 days off work.\n\nThe man went back to the doctor with symptoms of increased breathlessness, such as when walking from one room of his house to another. \"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 min[ute] activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest,\" the patient described in the case report. \"I was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep.\"\n\nHis general practitioner ordered a chest X-ray, which was considered to be normal. But when Dr. Owen Dempsey, a pulmonologist at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the UK, took a look, he disagreed and performed a more detailed CT scan. The scan revealed severe inflammation in the man's lungs.\n\nAfter questioning the patient on what could be triggering this allergic reaction, Dempsey and his team found a potential source: the man's feather bedding. Blood tests revealed that the man's body had created antibodies to a compound that he inhaled from duck or goose feathers. The patient was diagnosed with what's called \"feather duvet lung,\" a type of severe lung inflammation caused by an immune response to feathers.\n\nFeather duvet lung is a type of \"hypersensitive pneumonitis\" in which the body's immune response to a particular outside trigger causes the lung's air sacs and airways to become inflamed. \"I'm sure it happens much more than we realize,\" Dempsey said. What's more, there are many variations of hypersensitive pneumonitis, such as farmer's lung (where the allergen is dust from hay, corn or other crops) and wood-worker's lung (where the allergen is sawdust), he added. \"You name it, it probably has been described.\"\n\nThe patient was given steroids, and switched his bedding to hypoallergenic synthetic materials. His symptoms improved rapidly within a month, and by six months he felt well again. After a year, his symptoms completely cleared and he is now fully recovered, Dempsey said.\n\n\"It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before,\" the patient wrote in the case study.\n\nIt's important for health care providers to \"take really detailed histories\" of the patients, Dempsey said. \"That way they may uncover things in the environment that trigger lung disease.\"\n\nWhen doctors don't consider these triggers, they may assume the disease is \"unexplained,\" and diagnoses are delayed, or patients are treated unnecessarily or incorrectly, he added.\n\nThat being said, \"people with pillows and duvets containing feathers shouldn't panic or throw them out,\" he said. But if they have chest symptoms such as cough or breathlessness, they should let their health care professional know, he added.\n\nThe findings were published today (Nov. 18) in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.",

        "articleBody": "Earlier this month, NASA announced the newest milestone in the development of its long-awaited (and long-delayed) Space Launch System. At the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, workers completed installation of the four RS-25 engines into the rocket’s core stage. With those engines in place, the core stage will soon be ready for shipment to the nearby Stennis Space Center for testing, including a “Green Run” test around the middle of next year where those four engines will fire for eight minutes, just as they will on an SLS launch.\n\n“If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date,” Cooke said.\n\nThe SLS has been a key part of NASA’s exploration plans since the language in the 2010 NASA authorization act that directed the agency to develop it. While the plans themselves have changed, the agency has maintained that the SLS will nonetheless be essential for human spaceflight beyond Earth orbit, despite cost and schedule issues that have pushed back its first launch to at least late 2020, and more likely 2021. NASA has held firm despite criticisms that it would be better off adopting commercial alternatives, such as (but certainly not limited to) SpaceX.\n\nRecently, though, NASA is getting criticism from the opposite direction. Some members of Congress have suggested that NASA isn’t using SLS enough: that is, NASA is relying too much on those commercial options in its current exploration architecture, when the SLS, particularly its Block 1B variant with the more powerful Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), could handle it with fewer launches.\n\nThat criticism, interestingly, is coming from members of the administration’s own party in Congress. “Every space exploration study conducted over the last 40 years indicated that the most optimal architectures for exploring the Moon and Mars require a heavy-lift launch vehicle similar to SLS,” said Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX), ranking member of the House Science Committee’s space subcommittee, during a hearing last week on NASA’s exploration plans.\n\nHe raised that point in criticism of NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS) procurement, which sought proposals for commercially developed lunar landers that NASA could use to land humans on the Moon. Those landers would be launched, as NASA originally envisioned, on commercial vehicles (the final version did allow companies to propose launching them on the SLS, provided they worked with NASA and its contractors to get a cost estimate for a cargo version of the SLS.)\n\n“While I share the frustration and delays to the SLS program, switching horses midstream is not a wise move at this point,” he continued.\n\nHe and others at the hearing questioned NASA’s approach that, in their view, minimizes the use of the SLS to launching Orion spacecraft. Under NASA’s current architecture, elements of the lunar Gateway would be launched commercially, as well as logistics spacecraft to support the Gateway. The lunar landers would also use commercial launches (save for those that did propose using SLS): as many as three launches per lander, one each for the ascent module, descent module, and transfer stage that would move the lander from the Gateway to low lunar orbit.\n\nThat is, for some, way too many launches. “The fewer launches and critical operations per mission, the higher the probability of mission success,” said Doug Cooke, a former NASA associate administrator for exploration and now an industry consultant, during a September hearing by the same House subcommittee. (Cooke’s clients include Boeing, prime contractor for the SLS core stage, although many in the space community note he held similar views long before working with Boeing.)\n\n“If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” Stafford said of returning to the Moon.\n\n“SLS is not being used for what it was designed to do, other than carry Orion,” he continued. “If NASA focuses on the investment in the ongoing SLS with the EUS, Orion, and ground system developments, there is a better chance of making an earlier date.” He said a lunar landing could be achieved with two SLS missions, one carrying Orion and the other an integrated lander, with the two rendezvousing in lunar orbit—no Gateway required.\n\nAt last week’s hearing, the two invited witnesses, former astronaut Tom Stafford and retired aerospace executive Tom Young, backed up that assessment. Rep. Frank Lucas (R-OK), the ranking member of the full committee, asked them about the effect of multiple launches on commercial vehicles on mission safety.\n\n“The mission I did accomplished the whole thing with one launch,” Stafford, a member of the Apollo 10 crew, responded. He then referred to Cooke’s earlier testimony that concluded there was only a 50 percent chance of mission success with the current multiple-launch approach. “I cannot disagree with it.”\n\n“But with eight launches, I’ll have to go with Mr. Cooke: your probability of success goes down to about 50 percent,” he concluded.\n\n“Oh my,” Lucas responded with a sigh.\n\nStafford, earlier in the hearing, was adamant about the importance of a heavy-lift launch vehicle. “If you don’t have a big booster, you’re not going to make it,” he said. “You have to have a big shroud, which leads you to a big, wide-diameter booster. If you don’t have it, you’re not going to make it.”\n\nYoung, in his testimony, didn’t specifically address the use of SLS versus commercial rockets, but did criticize what he called “experiments” in procurement. “Managing and contracting experiments must be excluded from the Mars-Moon program,” he said. Asked later for an example of such an experiment, he brought up the HLS program.\n\n“A management experiment in my view would be to buy seats for crews to fly to the surface of the Moon,” he said. “I personally think that these should be government-acquired assets under the leadership and direction of NASA.”\n\nHe also said that NASA should drop some of its programs related to human spaceflight. “The plate is really full today,” he said. “I personally think that the leadership is going to have to, number one, prioritize, but number two is probably to eliminate some of the things that are currently being done that will interrupt having any opportunity of 2024, or I would say even 2028.”\n\nOne thing Young would push off NASA’s plate is the Gateway. “I do not really see a required role for the Gateway in the lunar program,” he said, although it could later support preparations for human missions to Mars. “There’s not a compelling argument to me for the Gateway for the lunar program.”\n\nBridenstine expects to produce three SLS rockets through 2024. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.”\n\nLast week’s hearing, though, was not the first time that Republican members of Congress questioned NASA’s use—or unwillingness to use—the SLS. At a hearing last month of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-AL), ranking member of the subcommittee, pushed for greater use of SLS.\n\n“I understand there is a growing confidence among the prime contractors for SLS to be able to produce two rockets a year starting in 2024,” he said, including the first Block 1B. “What do you think?”\n\n“It depends on what Boeing is willing to invest, quite frankly,” responded NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, noting that there wasn’t funding to support that increased production rate, even if it is possible.\n\n“We haven’t seen the performance yet that would indicate that we’re guaranteed the second core we’d need for a Moon landing in 2024,” added Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration and operations at NASA and the other witness at the hearing.\n\nAt current rates, Bridenstine said, there will be three SLS rockets produced by 2024: one for the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight, the second for the first crewed Orion flight, Artemis 2 in 2022, and then the Artemis 3 mission in 2024 that would take astronauts to the lunar Gateway, and from there to the surface of the Moon. “Adding an additional SLS into the mix could—I’m not confident that could happen.”\n\nAderholt returned to the issue later in the hearing. “What commercial launch vehicles exist today or that are in development that can or will be able to launch the HLS and get to the Moon to accomplish the goal of US boots on the Moon by 2024?”\n\nBridenstine responded that SLS is the only vehicle for launching humans. But for the landers, he and Bowersox listed several, including the Falcon Heavy and Starship from SpaceX, Vulcan from United Launch Alliance, New Glenn from Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman’s OmegA.\n\n“There could be an SLS-derived commercial solution,” Bridenstine added. “We’re not shutting the door on that opportunity. Of course, that would require some investment from Boeing to achieve.”\n\n“What is the contingency if, for some reason, those commercial rockets are not available by 2024,” Aderholt asked. Bridenstine noted that the Falcon Heavy is, in fact, in service today, unlike the other commercial vehicles—or SLS.\n\n“But if commercial’s not available, what’s the contingency plan?” Aderholt asked again.\n\n“I think, Mr. Ranking Member, that would put us in a position to make landing in 2024 very, very difficult,” Bridenstine said. “If we don’t have the additional rockets, then we’re not going to be able to achieve the goal. Btu we’re confident we’ll have those rockets.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” Babin said of potential spending shortfalls for Artemis.\n\nAderholt then turned to the issue of using larger numbers of smaller rockets, citing Cooke’s past testimony and a separate op-ed. Bridenstine acknowledged that more launches raised the risk of mission failure, but that the overall architecture needs to be assessed before concluding an approach with more launches was riskier than one with fewer launches.\n\n“We’re not specifying to any of the commercial providers for the Human Landing System how their systems ought to be developed,” Bridenstine said. “We’re waiting to have them tell us what their approach is, and then we’ll assess their approaches.”\n\nBoeing is one of the companies bidding on the HLS program, and confirmed that its approach makes use of the SLS. In a statement released November 5, the day the proposals were due to NASA, it said it submitted a proposal that would involve the launch of an integrated lander on an SLS Block 1B.\n\n“Using the lift capability of NASA’s Space Launch System Block 1B, we have developed a ‘Fewest Steps to the Moon’ approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,” Jim Chilton, senior vice president for space and launch at Boeing Defense, Space, and Security, said in that statement.\n\nThe only other entity to confirm it has bid on HLS is the “national team” led by Blue Origin that includes Draper, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. The companies have not disclosed how many of Blue Origin’s New Glenn vehicles would be needed to launch the three-element lunar lander. (SpaceX is widely believed to have submitted a proposal based on its Starship vehicle, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that.)\n\nNASA’s plans, though, depend on getting sufficient funding. Neither the House nor the Senate have provided all the money NASA requested in its $1.6 billion budget amendment in May that the agency says is essential to keeping Artemis on track. At that October appropriations hearing, Rep. José Serrano (D-NY), chairman of the subcommittee, was skeptical it would be forthcoming without more information about the overall cost of the Artemis program that NASA has yet to disclose.\n\n“It’s hard to justify any extra spending on this effort in the current fiscal year when we don’t know the costs down the road,” Serrano said. He suggested pushing back the date of a human return to the Moon to 2028, the goal prior to this March, “in order to have a successful, safe and cost-effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.”\n\nBabin referred to those comments at last week’s hearing, concluding that the odds of getting full funding for Artemis in fiscal year 2020 were ”dwindling.”\n\n“If this forces NASA to reassess its schedule for returning to the Moon, it would provide an opportunity to ensure that they are developing the ideal architecture that maximizes mission success and minimizes risk,” he said. “This could be done by developing landers that leverage the investments already made by the taxpayers in national capabilities like SLS and Orion.”\n\nOthers, though, might argue that any reassessment of NASA’s architecture for returning humans to the Moon promoted by a funding shortfall should also include revisiting SLS and Orion themselves.",

We’re on it.” campaign did not appeal to Julie Graham, Washington State Department of Health public information officer, she said she did not want to judge the campaign, and thinks it could still be successful for its audience.\n\n“When a group is trying to reach a very specific audience, the messaging can either be offensive or really miss the mark with the audience that’s not intended to see it,” Graham said.\n\nGraham said she once encountered backlash for an HIV prevention campaign that encouraged those recently released from jail to use condoms and receive screenings.\n\n“You might need to have a message that’s very unique to the population that might be at risk, and then you would want to put it in a place where you felt like it would have the best chance of reaching that audience, so you might have a little edgier message,” Graham said. “If somebody from the general public saw it, they might think, ‘Wow this is a little over the edge’ or they might think, ‘Why are they putting it here?’ It’s because it’s meant for a specific population.”\n\nTargeting audiences is key in making dollars go further, Graham said, offering the example of a recent domestic violence prevention campaign.\n\n“We were trying to reach young males, and we were doing our advertising on gaming sites, because we did some research that showed that that’s where a lot of young men were spending more time,” Graham said. “It can seem like there’s a thousand choices for where to put your money and where your audience might be looking now, but there is a benefit in having choices that are very audience-centric.”\n\nJeff Sanborn, president of Chapter & Verse, a Spokane and Seattle advertising and design agency, said he thought South Dakota’s campaign – run by a Minneapolis-based firm with a budget of $449,000 – was meant to raise eyebrows.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, he posted materials from the campaign on the wall by the dining table of the company’s kitchen, where he posts new marketing findings and other things for members of his firm to ponder.\n\n“OK, great, let’s be provocative, let’s get people to notice it and talk about it, but I don’t think people are talking about it in the way that you want them talking about it, right?” Sanborn said. “What’s America talking about? South Dakota’s got a meth problem, so that’s not the best thing for the South Dakota brand.”\n\nSanborn said the campaign made the mistake of burying the message. That message is that anyone using meth is a problem for everyone and “we want to try to help,” Sanborn said.\n\n“The problem is, we tell clients all the time, they’ll put the heart of their message somewhere deep in their third paragraph,” Sanborn said. “If that’s the core and heart of your message, you better make that the five words that everybody in America reads.”",

        "articleBody": "NASA has recruited SpaceX's Starship, Blue Origin's Blue Moon and three other commercial lunar lander ideas to join its Arte mis m oon program.\n\nToday (Nov. 18), NASA announced the selection of SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Ceres Robotics and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc. to join its Commercial Lunar Payload Services program (CLPS). The five companies can now vie to deliver robotic payloads to the lunar surface for NASA, helping to pave the way for the return of astronauts to the moon by 2024.\n\n\"American aerospace companies of all sizes are joining the Artemis program,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"Expanding the group of companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the moon's surface drives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers. We anticipate opportunities to deliver a wide range of science and technology payloads to help make our vision for lunar exploration a reality and advance our goal of sending humans to explore Mars.\"\n\nThe five companies join nine others selected by CLPS in November 2018, bringing the total number of private moon lander hopefuls to 14 firms.\n\nThe newly selected five are:\n\nBlue Origin, Kent, Washington\nCeres Robotics, Palo Alto, California\nSierra Nevada Corporation, Louisville, Colorado\nSpaceX, Hawthorne, California\nTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems Inc., Irvine, California\n\nThey include moon lander concepts of all sizes. They range from the truly massive — SpaceX's towering Starship vehicle — to land multiple rovers on the moon, to the smaller one-off probes like the boxy concept proposed by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems.\n\n\"The CLPS initiative was designed to leverage the expertise and innovation of private industry to get to the Moon quickly,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, said in the statement. \"As we build a steady cadence of deliveries, we’ll expand our ability to do new science on the lunar surface, develop new technologies, and support human exploration objectives.\"\n\nBlue Origin's lander concept is based on its Blue Moon uncrewed vehicle, which the company's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos announced earlier this year.\n\nSierra Nevada Corp. and Ceres Robotics are developing mid-sized landers that could potentially be scaled up to larger vehicles in the future.\n\nNASA plans to use private moon landers built by these partner companies to deliver rovers like the agency's new Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole. Other payloads could include power stations, science experiments and other lunar infrastructure.\n\nNASA plans to spend a total of $2.6 billion on its CLPS contracts through November 2028, agency officials said. The 14 companies currently in the program can bid on NASA delivery services.\n\n\"All of them bring to the table different strengths and different ideas,\" Clarke said in a telecon with reporters today. \"That's the intent, is to really broaden the pool — to bring on additional capabilities with new, innovative ideas so that our solution set is somewhat broader now.\"\n\nIn July, NASA awarded the first three contracts under the program, awarding lander missions to companies Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines and Orbit Beyond. Orbit Beyond dropped out of that contract but remains eligible to bid on future opportunities.\n\n\"Buying rides to the Moon to conduct science investigations and test new technology systems, instead of owning the delivery systems, enables NASA to do much more, sooner and for less cost, while being one of many customers on our commercial partners' landers,\" NASA's Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in the science directorate, said in the statement.\n\nArtemis aims to put the first woman, and the next man, on the lunar surface by 2024 and to establish a long-term, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by 2028.\n\nSuch activities will help NASA develop the expertise necessary to put boots on Mars, something the agency wants to do in the 2030s, agency officials have stressed.\n\nNASA is also looking to the private sector to develop crewed moon landers. This past May, the agency selected 11 companies to conduct studies and build prototypes. These 11 had until Nov. 1 to submit detailed proposals for the Artemis human lander, and NASA is expected to pick up to four finalists early next year.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated at 5:45 p.m. ET to include details from the NASA telecon.\n\n(Image credit: All About Space)",

        "articleBody": "Business focus is why some people are able to build the online business they dream of while others think about it … but never actually create it?\n\nAnd why is it that some people are able to build an online presence … but never get it to the level where they can live off the revenue it creates?\n\nWhy — especially — does it seem like certain people come out of nowhere and claim their place in your area of expertise before you’ve had a chance to claim it yourself?\n\nSo frustrating …\n\nWelcome to my business focus strategy lesson\n\nToday, we’re going to talk about why focus is important for success. Why it’s crucial, actually!\n\nIf we haven’t met yet, my name is Pamela Wilson — and I have been working online since 2010.\n\nI’m a three-time author, a keynote speaker, and an online educator, coach, and mastermind group leader.\n\nI help people build online businesses they love.\n\nIn this article, and in the coming weeks, I’m sharing my approach to online business growth.\n\nIt was born from helping thousands of people create the online presence they’ve dreamt of — and seeing way too many of them lose focus and struggle to get any results at all.\n\nOnce you understand my simple approach, you’ll feel much better about where you are in the online business growth process — and that’s a promise.\n\nHow can I promise you’re about to feel better?\n\nBecause once you understand my approach …\n\nYou’ll recognize you don’t have to master everything about online business all at once\nYour to-do list will shrink to 25% of its current size\nYou’ll be able to safely ignore 75% of the online information you’re seeing right now\n\nGet ready to start enjoying the process of building your online business — maybe for the first time ever!\n\nIf you are …\n\nTrying to build an online business because you have deep expertise on a specific topic — but you’re “on hold” because you’re feeling overwhelmed\nWanting to leave a legacy of information and guidance around a topic you’re passionate about — but you don’t know where to start\nPassionate about the business idea you’ve imagined — but unsure about how to make it happen\n\n… stick around. What you’re about to read is critical information that could change the course of your life.\n\nReally.\n\nHow to maintain a business focus the easy way\n\nThe goal of this series of articles is to help you steadily build the online business you have in mind right now — without ever feeling lost and overwhelmed.\n\nYou’re about to feel the relief that comes from having a clear business focus.\n\nYou’ll understand what matters now — and what you can ignore.\n\nThis is the key to making steady progress as you build your online presence!\n\nA genius approach to online business building?\n\nNot to get too Albert Einstein on you, but …\n\nEvery online business exists in the 'space-time continuum.'\n\nThink about it:\n\nYou build your website in its own little corner of the internet\nSearch engines find it at the moment in time that it goes live\nPeople begin to discover and use it\nYour relationship with the people you attract grows person-by-person and day-by-day\n\nThe faster you can create an online business that exists in both space and time, the faster these benefits will accrue:\n\nSearch engines will drive people to your information\nYou’ll go from imagining the people you want to serve to serving real people\nYour email list will begin to grow\nYour products and services will all benefit from the interaction\nYour revenues and impact will grow year-by-year\n\nAre you ready to make this happen?\n\nHow to avoid falling for every online pitch you see\n\nBefore we start, I’ve got to warn you about something that’s critically important. Not paying attention to this will virtually guarantee that you will stay stuck where you are.\n\nAnd you’ll have a lot less money in your bank account.\n\nHere’s the thing …\n\nWhen you step into the online space, you’ll meet a whole new cast of characters. And they will try to sell you some pretty compelling stories.\n\nI'm here to tell you that the Laws of Physics apply to online business just like offline business.\n\nIt takes time to build a successful business — offline and online.\n\n(I know, radical statement, right?)\n\nI want you to embrace this reality — because I’m about to show you how to get time on your side.\n\nTrying to build an online business isn’t as simple as lots of people would have you believe. It has its challenges.\n\nThere’s a lot of technology to master. There’s marketing involved — a lot of marketing. Maybe more marketing than you’re comfortable with.\n\nAnd there are all these moving parts — disparate bits of software that needs to interact to present your business and your offers seamlessly.\n\nToday, I’m going to demystify the process of building your online business.\n\nYou’re about to save some major frustration, my friend. Money, too! Because it turns out your don’t need to Buy All The Things and Learn All The Things in order to make it online.\n\nI developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and error — mine, and the people I taught.\n\nIt’s called Plan & Grow BIG.\n\nFocus on what really matters in the near future of your business\n\nPlan & Grow BIG helps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might be stopping you from making real progress in your online business.\n\nMaybe you’re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you’ve been trying for years to build a business idea you’ve had in your head — but it just isn’t living up to what you expected.\n\nEither way, you’re in the right place because today’s information will help you catapult forward.\n\nI developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting sidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they “needed” to master.\n\nFor example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads — before they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were going to offer.\n\nAnd I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was proven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an unproven product.)\n\nI saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. 🙁\n\nSmart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But they were completely baffled by this “online business thing.”\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the frustrations myself.\n\nTrue confession: I had to learn business focus the hard way\n\nBefore I outline the Plan & Grow BIG approach and the specifics for each stage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out.\n\nI’m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this.\n\nBack in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business, Zurek Design.\n\nI had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled projects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also juggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their “launch” phases — they were in high school and starting to look at universities and think about their careers.\n\nI didn’t have a lot of time to spare.\n\nPlus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become much more of a “public figure” than I had ever had to be in my business in the past. I’d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And I’d need to “put myself out there” on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars, and in online video.\n\nYikes.\n\nAnd although my offline business was making a solid income, my online business idea — to share my marketing and design training with others — wasn’t making a single cent.\n\nWho in their right mind invests in a business idea before they know if it will make money?\n\nI do, apparently!\n\nIt turns out that I was more courageous than I knew.\n\nBecause I did — I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course called Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time — an enormous amount of money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point.\n\nBut I’m glad I did.\n\nI truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that investment, I was telling myself, “This dream matters. This dream is going to become a reality. I’m taking this seriously.”\n\nOnce I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new, things started happening for me.\n\nWithin a few months, I (the person who didn’t want to be seen online) had an article accepted by the company behind the course I took — on one of the most-popular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger.\n\nThen another article went live. And another.\n\nNot just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the day.\n\nAnd through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then coaching.\n\nOut with the old, in with the new (and better)\n\nWithin a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline business made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to focus exclusively on my online efforts.\n\nNow, I’m considered an authority on building an online presence.\n\nThat company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach their audience for a couple of years.\n\nHere’s what’s different in my life now:\n\nMy business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas)\nI am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from me\nMy books are well-received and much loved — and deliver income to me every single month\nPeople find my website and join my community every day, all year long\nI’m able to travel anywhere I’d like because my business fits in my backpack\nI can “dial up” or “dial back” my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my schedule\n\nHere’s the other important thing …\n\nI also have complete control over the direction I take my business. I answer to no one but myself! And I can adapt my offerings to what my audience needs whenever I’d like.\n\nBut this story isn’t about me.\n\nWhat I’m about to share is the exact plan I’ve developed after seeing what truly works online.\n\nIt’s the approach that has allowed me to build the business I have today. A business where I’m in control — of my time, my projects, my earnings.\n\nAnd that’s what I want for you.\n\nReady to make online business building easier?\n\nYou wouldn’t have read this far if you didn’t also want to build this kind of online business!\n\nThat’s why I want to make it easier for you.\n\nWhat is your business focus right now?\n\nIf you can’t answer that question immediately, read on.\n\nHow to use Plan & Grow BIG to get the business focus mindset you need\n\nThe purpose of the Plan & Grow BIG approach is to help you develop business focus — and eliminate the feeling of overwhelm that keeps you from making progress.\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nI believe the #1 enemy of online progress is the flood of information about online business tactics that bombards us every day.\n\nI want to show you how you can ignore most of the information you see!\n\nAnd how developing business focus will allow you to build the business you’re dreaming about much faster — and with less frustration.\n\nTo get started, I created a simple quiz and resource doc that will help you get more value from this article.\n\nGrab my 12-question quiz that will help you pinpoint the stage you’re in right now — and get guidance about how to maximize your results.\n\nClick the link above so you can:\n\nDiscover what business-building stage you’re in now\nAssess what you’re starting with — make a list of your current assets\nPinpoint what your current business focus should be\nGet to know what happens in the other business stages — so you can focus\n\nDownload it here so you can apply this to your business:\n\nAs we go through each stage of the Plan & Grow BIG approach, I want you to identify areas of opportunity for your current situation.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nThe four simple stages of Plan & Grow BIG\n\nThe Plan Stage: Think and dream productively\n\nIt’s the early days of your business.\n\nThink BIG. And work only on what’s needed in this stage.\n\nIn the PLAN stage, make these your business focus:\n\nPinpoint your ideal customer: Who will your online business serve? Warning: many people try to skip this step — don’t! You need to become acquainted with the people you want to reach and help before you build your branding and offers.\nGet your branding in place: The earlier the better when it comes to\nbuilding your brand. You’ll want to decide your business name and\ntagline, select your brand colors, and choose your brand fonts.\nMap out your first offer: Decide how what solutions you’ll deliver and how you’ll deliver them. Will they be products, services, or both?\n\nThat’s it. Once you’ve completed the items above, it’s time to start building your business, my friend. Ready?\n\nThe Build Stage: Create a tangible online asset\n\nTime to make ideas real. As you build these tangible business assets, remember: you don’t have to do it all at once.\n\nFocus on these business goals during the BUILD stage:\n\nBuild your initial website: You’ll need a Homepage, an About page, a Contact page, and some kind of “commerce” page, like a Store or Services page. Attract prospects by publishing regular content like blog articles, podcast episodes, or a video series.\nBuild your first offer: Don’t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that’s relatively simple — but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that.\nBuild an initial funnel: Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers.\n\nAnd now … stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it’s tempting to look around at Version 9.0 of your competitors’ sites and feel like you have to catch up to them.\n\nNonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and be proud you’re ready to move on …\n\nThe Implement Stage: Iterate to find what works\n\nOooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can feel deeply uncomfortable.\n\nBut growth usually does feel uncomfortable, doesn’t it?\n\nThe IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that’s perfectly fine. Here’s what you’ll focus on while you’re there:\n\nMake your offers live: Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great — but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs.\nFocus on building your email list. Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list — think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a referral network.\nDiscover what works for launching your products and services. Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience.\n\nRemember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to develop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business. Patience, my friend!\n\nBut once you’ve hit on a winning product or service, you’ll be ready for …\n\nThe Grow Stage: Leverage your success\n\nIn the GROW stage, you’ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably in your business — and now you’ll focus on leveraging that success.\n\nImprove your conversion rates: Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what’s working. You’ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible.\nAdd more revenue streams: As you dial into what’s working well, you may uncover your customers’ unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You’ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream.\n\nThe GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are reliable and you’re able to make some serious investments in your business.\n\nReady? Set? Business focus!\n\nNow that you know your business stage (you DID download the quiz, right?), you can tap into the power of focused attention and make fast progress. Ignore all the techniques you’ll need in future stages, and just aim to master the stage you’re in.\n\nGet the Online Business Success Roadmap for an overview and a handy checklist of all the Plan & Grow BIG stages.\n\nWhen you do this, you can count on steady business growth — with less frustration and more confidence because you’re focused on the right thing at the right time.\n\nThe next BIG challenge is …\n\nNow that you’re clear about how to use a focused approach to eliminate frustration and make faster progress, here’s the next big online business challenge …\n\nBecoming a “visible” and public leader in your space.\n\nThis was a HUGE stumbling block for me.\n\nIn the next article, I’m going to share my mindset tips and tricks to help you become more comfortable with becoming a visible online leader. Once you embrace the increased visibility that comes with building an online business, you’ll see all sorts of interesting doors open up.\n\nYour go-forward plan for business focus\n\nThe BIG question is, how do you successfully shape an online business dream into a viable online business that gives you the income, freedom, and recognition you deserve?\n\nIt comes down to business focus. Which is easy once you know what to focus on, and what to ignore.\n\nOnce you’ve built that business, you have to stand out in front of it and represent it in your marketing, on social media, and at in-person events.\n\nIf you don’t master this, you’ll severely limit your reach and your impact. So how do you get comfortable with this increased visibility?\n\nHow can you step up and embrace the “internet limelight?” Because once you do, online doors will open for you!\n\nRead about that topic in the next article in this series, How to Adopt an Online Leader Success Mindset.\n\nPamela Wilsonbigbrandsystem",

        "articleBody": "WASHINGTON – Two federal prison officers were charged Tuesday with falsifying records, stating they had checked on accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in the hours before he hanged himself in his Manhattan cell.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, assigned to Epstein's special housing unit at Metropolitan Correctional Center, \"browsed the Internet,\" lingered in an office common area and appeared to sleep for two hours when they should have been conducting inmate checks.\n\nNoel and Thomas signed \"false certifications\" attesting they had made their required rounds, according to court records.\n\nProsecutors alleged that no inmate checks were made from 10:30 p.m. Aug. 9 to 6:30 a.m. the following morning, when the officers discovered Epstein's body. During that time, the officers should have conducted five separate inmate counts in the high-security unit. A review of surveillance video allegedly showed the two officers asleep at their desks at one point during the night, according to court documents.\n\n“As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center,” Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a news release. “Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction.”\n\nEach defendant is charged with one count of conspiring to falsify records. Noel, 31, is charged with five counts of falsifying records; Thomas, 41, is charged with three.\n\nThe conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Each of the charges of falsifying records carries a maximum sentence of five years.\n\nNoel and Thomas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday afternoon and were released on the condition that each post $100,000 bond within a week.\n\nEpstein's sudden death triggered a wave of recriminations from his many victims, who had anticipated his trial on sex trafficking and related conspiracy charges.\n\nHis suicide prompted a leadership shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons. Attorney General William Barr put Kathleen Hawk Sawyer in charge and ordered multiple investigations into the 66-year-old's suicide, focusing on operations at the Manhattan facility where Epstein was held.\n\nIndictments unsealed as head of prison agency testified before Congress\n\nAs the charges were unsealed in New York, Hawk Sawyer testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, where lawmakers expressed outrage over the security breakdown revealed by Epstein's suicide.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called his death \"a crisis of public trust\" within the prison system.\n\n\"You are in this job because of this crisis,\" Sasse told Hawk Sawyer, repeatedly calling for an explanation of how the system failed to keep track of such a high-profile inmate. \"That bastard now won't be able to testify against his other co-conspirators.\"\n\nProsecutors alleged that Epstein \"sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls\" at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from at least 2002 to 2005.\n\nSasse said the charges against the two staffers are overdue.\n\n\"Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died,\" he said. \"The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they’re not the end of this.\n\n\"These guards aren’t the only ones who should stand trial – every one of Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars,” Sasse said.\n\nHawk Sawyer said she couldn't comment on the ongoing criminal investigation and a review by the Justice Department's inspector general. But she acknowledged that prison authorities discovered at least \"a couple of other instances\" in which officers failed to conduct required checks on inmates and falsified records to show that they had.\n\n\"We don't want those people\" working in federal prisons, she said. \"This incident was a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff. The only time we ever noticed is when something bad happens.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Epstein's death is a symptom of deeper problems within the prison system. Cruz called the suicide a \"profound indictment of the system.\"\n\nAlthough representatives of Epstein's family suggested the disgraced financier may have been murdered, Hawk Sawyer told lawmakers no evidence supports anything other than suicide.\n\nInternal memo: Federal prison guards falsified records of cell checks, inmate counts\n\nInvestigators focused on how Epstein had the opportunity to hang himself\n\nBefore New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself with a bedsheet, his death was shadowed by conspiracy theories suggesting he had been murdered.\n\nFor months, federal authorities examined the conduct of the staffers assigned to Epstein's unit and how he escaped notice.\n\nTuesday, prosecutors asserted that Noel and Thomas were the only officers assigned to Epstein's housing unit, and no inmate checks were conducted for at least eight hours. When the officers discovered Epstein's body Aug. 10, prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas both acknowledged to supervisors that they had not made their required checks.\n\n\"We messed up; I messed up,\" Thomas allegedly told a supervisor. \"We didn't do any rounds.\"\n\nRoughly 14 supporters and friends of Noel and Thomas attended the court hearing. Some wore clothing with Bureau of Prisons markings or union logos. They and the defendants left without responding to reporters’ questions.\n\nDefense attorneys said the two were prepared to fight the charges. “It is our hope that we’ll be able to reach a reasonable agreement in this case,” said Jason Foy, who represents Noel.\n\nMontell Figgins, who represents Thomas, said his client chose not to accept a plea agreement offered by prosecutors. He said Thomas is a single father of three children, and a guilty plea would “ruin his life.”\n\n“We had hoped that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would try to make an effort to address the systematic failures with respect to the Bureau of Prisons,” Figgins said.\n\nSometimes employees don't follow the rules, he said. \"But does that mean that they’re going to be indicted and put into a position like this where they’re going to face going to jail and losing their whole career?”\n\nFiggins declined to address whether Thomas slept on the job on the night Epstein died. “When all the evidence is presented about how the system was ran and how they were severely short-staffed at all times,\" he said, \"maybe you’ll have a different appreciation for what was going on.”\n\nPrisons plagued by understaffing\n\nPrison union representatives have long warned that staff shortages and frequent overtime shifts have taken their toll on officers and compromised security at the Manhattan facility.\n\nStaffers 'don't care': Federal prison suicides were quietly rising before Jeffrey Epstein's death in a New York detention center\n\nAt the time of Epstein's suicide, there were more than 30 staff vacancies at the facility, said Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union. Prison officials regularly assigned civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions, she said.\n\nTen of the 18 staffers who reported for duty on the midnight-to-8 a.m. shift, the one on which Epstein was found dead, were working overtime, according to federal prison records. On the previous shift, 4 p.m. to midnight, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.\n\nAfter Epstein's death, Barr reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and prison officials placed Noel and Thomas on administrative leave. One of the officers, according to prison records, had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.\n\nHawk Sawyer acknowledged significant staffing shortages Tuesday, telling lawmakers that prison officials are working to fill 3,000 vacancies across the system.\n\nMany of the prisons, she said, are aging and need to be repaired. The failure of old camera systems prompted an effort to replace them at prisons around the country, including at the Manhattan detention center.\n\nAfter the hearing, Hawk Sawyer issued a statement about the charges, saying, \"I am committed to this agency and am confident we will restore the public’s trust in us.”\n\nEpstein's inner circle eyed: Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Prosecutors could still go after his inner circle if they helped him prey on young girls\n\nEpstein removed from suicide watch\n\nThree weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell, semiconscious with bruises on his neck. That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring days later, which has drawn investigative interest.\n\nExperts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide.\n\n“When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego.\n\nBoesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt.\n\nJack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death.\n\n“Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.”\n\nContributing: Kristine Phillips",

        "articleBody": "Three cases of plague have been diagnosed in China, sparking widespread fears about the spread of the disease, though officials say the risk of an outbreak is low.\n\nAs Emily Feng reports for NPR, the first cases came to light last week, when authorities in Beijing announced that two infected individuals sought treatment at a hospital in the capital. The patients, a husband and wife, are from Inner Mongolia, an autonomous and sparsely populated region in the northern part of the country. They were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, one of the two main forms of infection caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis —the other being bubonic plague, which can advance to pneumonic plague if the infection spreads to the lungs. Yersinia pestis, per the WHO, is often found in small mammals and their fleas.\n\nPneumonic plague is the most deadly form of the disease. It is highly contagious, spreading from person to person via infected respiratory droplets. Without medical intervention, the disease is inevitably fatal. But recovery rates are high if it is detected and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.\n\nThe ailing couple was quarantined, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said it had conducted epidemiological investigations on people who might have been exposed to the patients, according to Sui-Lee Wee of the New York Times. All “relevant sites” were also disinfected, reports Wee. The CDC assured the public on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media site, that the risks of transmission were “extremely low.”\n\nOn November 16, a third case of plague was reported in a 55-year-old man, also from Inner Mongolia. He had, according to Alex Horton of the Washington Post, killed and eaten a wild rabbit before he was taken to a hospital around 185 miles northwest of Beijing. The man was diagnosed with bubonic plague.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that 28 people who came into contact with the patient were quarantined, and displayed no symptoms of plague—like the sudden onset of fever, body aches, vomiting and nausea. As yet, there is no epidemiological evidence linking the third plague case to the earlier two, the Inner Mongolia health commission said, according to Reuters.\n\nOver the centuries, plague has killed millions of people around the world, most famously during the Black Death, which wiped out nearly one-third of Europe’s population in the 1300s. Yersinia pestis is believed to have originated in China, spreading to the West via ships. Today, plague infections are rare, but they do happen. According to WHO, there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide between 2010 and 2015, with 584 deaths. China has experienced a small smattering of plague infections in recent years—26 cases and 11 deaths between 2009 and 2018, reports Reuters.\n\nThough the government has attempted to reassure the Chinese public in the wake of the recent diagnoses, many have voiced concerns that officials are minimizing or even restricting information about the cases.\n\nThe first two illnesses were confirmed on November 12. But according to NPR ’s Feng, Li Jifeng, a doctor at Chaoyang Hospital where the patients were treated, wrote in a blog post that the couple had been transported to the facility on November 3—nine days before an announcement was made, raising questions about the reason for the delay.\n\nLi explained that plague cases need to be carefully investigated and verified, and announcements about them cannot be “transmitted casually.” But her post was still taken down by censors. Wee of the Times reports that censors had also instructed digital news aggregators to “block and control” discussions pertaining the news about the plague.\n\n“Don't hide things like this,” one Weibo commenter said, per Feng. “Let’s face whatever it is together.”\n\nCurrent fears about a potential plague outbreak are perhaps being fuelled by China’s handling of past health crises. In 2003, authorities there were accused of concealing the true extent of the country’s SARS outbreak—and Beijing officials ultimately admitted that the city had experienced 10 times as many cases as they had initially reported.\n\nIn the wake of that outbreak, China “vastly improved its detection and management of infectious diseases,” writes the Associated Press. And though the Chinese CDC has said that there is “no need” for Beijing residents to worry about the risk of plague infection, it has also acknowledged that remote regions of the country—like Yunnan and the Qinghai-Tibet plateau—are vulnerable to outbreaks. Officials have warned people to stay away from infected areas, and to avoid contact with rodents.",

        "articleBody": "Taylor Swift's big night; Britney Spears' new pop-up\n\nHollywood Nation: Taylor Swift will be honored with the coveted Artist of the Decade award at the 2019 American Music Awards ceremony; Britney Spears is giving devoted followers the ultimate fan experience with a Los Angeles pop-up and retail shop celebrating the pop star's iconic career opening in January 2020.\n\nScooter Braun is allegedly unhappy with the way his business partner Scott Borchetta has handled their ongoing public schism with Taylor Swift, according to a new report by E! News.\n\n\"Scooter is frustrated because his name is being dragged in the mud,\" an insider told the outlet on Monday. \"He doesn't run Big Machine or have operational control of [the] company. He hasn't taken part in these negotiations.\"\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing public fissure between Swift and her former record label, Big Machine Records, Braun, 38 – who reps the likes of Justin Beiber, Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande – has been trying to get a hold of Swift, 29, however the “Bad Blood” songstress allegedly hasn’t been returning Braun’s calls, the source further claimed to the outlet.\n\n\"This fight with Taylor is not something Scooter agrees with,\" the insider added of the continuing spat.\n\nOn Monday, Big Machine Records issued a statement that appeared to make it possible for Swift to perform her songs at the upcoming American Music Awards after Swift publicly scolded her former label, accusing the Braun-owned company of preventing her from performing her earlier hits, to which they own the master recordings, at the AMAs\n\nThe statement, which was obtained by Variety, claimed that Big Machine and Dick Clark Productions had “come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platform.” The agreement maintained that it would not only cover Swift’s performance, but the performance of Thomas Rhett as well.\n\n\"It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed,” the statement continued.\n\nHowever, shortly after news broke on Monday that the two companies had come to an agreement on the use of Swift's music, Dick Clark Productions denied that it had settled on an arrangement with the music label.\n\n“At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the production company said in a separate statement to Rolling Stone. “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”\n\nOn Thursday, Swift took to social media and accused Braun, Borchetta and Big Machine of also disallowing the production of a Netflix documentary she has been working on where her music was to be used.\n\nThe company flat-out denied the allegations in a statement shared to its website.\n\n\"As Taylor Swift's partner for over a decade, we were shocked to see her tumblr statements yesterday based on false information,\" the statement read. \"At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor's decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to honor all of her requests to license her catalog to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.\"\n\n\"The truth is, Taylor has admitted to contractually owing millions of dollars and multiple assets to our company, which is responsible for 120 hardworking employees who helped build her career,\" the statement continued. \"We have worked diligently to have a conversation about these matters with Taylor and her team to productively move forward.\n\n\"We started to see progress over the past two weeks and were optimistic as recently as yesterday that this may get resolved. However, despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,\" the statement concluded.\n\nSwift's rep told Fox News that this, too, was not the whole truth. \"Big Machine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them but, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes Taylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.\"\n\nA rep for Braun did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.",

        "articleBody": "If you’re like me and you don’t follow football throughout the season, you can always find something to love about game day — whether it’s rooting for the underdog, enjoying the halftime show and the commercials, or just having a good time with friends and family.\n\nAs co-creator of the weight-loss program 2B Mindset, I want to help you enjoy everything about game day, including those delicious snacks!\n\nFootball food is “ comfort food ” — pizza, wings, chips, dips, and subs — and they can be very hard to resist.\n\nBut it’s important to remember that we’re fueling our bodies to watch football, not actually play it!\n\n5 Tips to Enjoy Game Day Parties While Staying on Track With Your Weight-Loss Goals:\n\n1. Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize\n\nI know — it all looks so good. But you can’t eat it all, so it’s time to set priorities.\n\nSeek out the healthy game day snacks — those that are vegetable based, low in fat, and high in fiber. Look for lean proteins that will help you feel full, so you’re less tempted by the high-calorie snacks.\n\nAnd you don’t have to deny yourself a cheesy treat or decadent dessert. Just choose the one or two indulgences you just can’t live without and leave it at that.\n\n2. Don’t forget to drink water\n\nStaying hydrated is your best defense against mindless eating (and can even help prevent a hangover), so if you’re drinking beer, wine, or anything else alcoholic, make sure you drink water first then alternate every bottle of beer with a large glass of water.\n\nDrinking all that water keeps your belly full and keeps your hands busy instead of mindlessly grabbing all the munchies lying in front of you just because they’re there.\n\n3. Instead of reaching for a snack, make a plate\n\nMost of us think we overeat when the food is really good, or when we’re feeling especially hungry.\n\nBut the fact is, the biggest cause of overeating is not paying attention!\n\nThat’s especially true when we are watching TV: A handful of chips and guacamole here, a chicken wing or two there — and without realizing it, we’ve consumed several hundred calories without even enjoying our food, let alone feeling full or satisfied.\n\nSo when you reach for the finger foods, pay attention, set them on a plate, and eat from there.\n\nPutting your food on a plate is a simple way to know how much you’re eating, and to help you pace yourself so that you don’t overdo it.\n\nKeep your eyes on the prize and don’t let your fingers do the walking.\n\n4. “Veggie-fy” your chips ‘n’ dip\n\nNothing goes together with football like a crunchy plate of chips and a creamy dip. But instead of the usual, try swapping regular chips with a veggie instead.\n\nBecause let’s be honest, what you like about the chip is its crunch and the fact that it’s the vehicle to enjoy those delicious dips.\n\nSo swap out a handful of regular potato chips for carrot sticks to scoop up your favorite dip and you’ll see that you’ll still get all the flavor and crunchy satisfaction you want!\n\nAnd don’t forget to veggie-fy your dips as well. Opt for salsa (which has around four calories per tablespoon) rather than a cream cheese- or mayonnaise-based dip — those can pack over 10 times more calories than salsa.\n\nHealthy Game Day Dip:\n\nMix two tablespoons of vegetarian refried beans with two tablespoons of salsa. A quarter cup is roughly 33 calories. Enjoy with a cup of cucumber slices and you’ll get plenty of tangy crunch — without all the calories.\n\n5. Go topless (with your sub)\n\nEven small, six-inch subs are a foot-long helping of bread when you count both sides of the sandwich.\n\nBy taking off just the top half of bread, you’re saving nearly 100 calories — about the same as a bottle of light beer.\n\nRemember what I said about choosing your treats? This is an easy way to be smart about enjoying game day food without having to tell yourself “no.” That’s why I always tell my clients: “an open face is a happy face!”\n\nMy goal is for you to have a great time watching the game, whether you’re out at a party or having friends over to your house. You can enjoy the action, the great company, and yes, even the game day snacks — without overdoing it!\n\nGet started with 2B Mindset here.",

There’s a way to do this that’s not stressful and that builds naturally from one experience to another.\n\nMy goal with this article is to show you a way to become more comfortable standing both behind and in front of the online business you’re building. Ready?\n\nHave you experienced these “moments of personal growth?”\n\nAny time you’re building a business — online or offline — you’re going to experience some moments that cause you to … well, let’s say they cause you to grow as a person.\n\nThat’s putting a pleasant spin on it, isn’t it?\n\nMaybe you’ve experienced these moments before:\n\nYou’re putting together a first offer and then it hits you — “Oh, if I want people to buy this, I have to market it … not just now, but forever!”\nYou know that in order to reach prospects you’ve got to extend yourself. But yikes … outreach is so uncomfortable!\nYou’re given opportunities to be more visible — maybe it’s an interview request or a small speaking gig — and you’re terrified to say “yes.”\n\nIf you’ve experienced any of these challenging moments, guess what? You’re normal! And they help to form your success mindset.\n\nBut if you stay stuck in these moments and don’t move beyond them, your business won’t become what it can be.\n\nYour introverted side will stay cozy and comfortable, that’s for sure.\n\nBut you will always wonder, “What would have happened if I’d experienced the momentary discomfort and pushed past it?”\n\nThat’s what we’re going to cover here: a way to embrace a success mindset and push beyond the momentary discomfort so you can experience everything that’s waiting for you on the other side.\n\nBeware the deep end\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s talk about the deep end for a moment.\n\nThere are a lot of people online who are pushing their solutions for gaining visibility in your online business. They’re selling:\n\nCourses on writing a book\nWorkshops on becoming a highly paid speaker\nClasses on running successful webinars\n\nThese are all good things. They’re all things I’ve done myself! But if you take courses on doing these “deep end” things before you’ve done some of the “shallow end” things I’m about to share, you may end up feeling intimidated — not inspired.\n\nAnd sadly, you may never take the first steps.\n\nThat’s what I’m about to cover … the first steps. They’re crucial!\n\nRead on for three tips that will help you build a firm foundation for online leadership so that courses like the ones above feel like a natural next step.\n\n1. Start small and recognize that no one is watching\n\nHere’s an analogy:\n\nWhen you’re in the planning and in the early building stages of your online businesses — planning your website and offers, and building the first-draft versions of both — there’s a helpful way to think about what you’re doing.\n\nImagine you’re in an auditorium in the backstage area, and the curtains are drawn. No one in the audience can see what you’re doing back there!\n\nYou’re planning and building what you’ll reveal to the world — but you haven’t pulled back the curtains and invited them in.\n\nHere’s what I want you to remember …\n\nWhen you do finally pull back those curtains with your heart in your throat and sweat beading on your upper lip?\n\nNo one is watching.\n\nI mean, if you’re lucky a few family members and friends are in your audience in the early days. But for the most part? There’s almost no one there.\n\nIt’s the perfect time to explore making yourself more visible. With fewer people watching your first visibility attempts, you won’t feel as intimidated by the process.\n\nSo start small and experiment! More on ways to experiment in the next section …\n\n2. Don’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1\n\nA few years ago, I was honored to be asked to speak twice at Darren Rowse’s Problogger conference in Australia. The topic of one of my presentations was creating online “events” that build your audience.\n\nIn that presentation I talked about how the online world gives you many opportunities to step out of your comfort zone.\n\nAnd I used this highly scientific graphic to illustrate the idea:\n\nIt got a good laugh! And I made my point, which is …\n\nIt’s smart to start with less-intimidating things and work your way up to the more intimidating things.\n\nIncreasing your visibility gradually lets you grow into your online leadership role with much less stress.\n\nEveryone’s list will be different. For me, the online visibility spectrum used to look like this:\n\nNOT SCARY\n\nWriting a blog post\nWriting a piece of email marketing\nSpeaking to someone on the phone\n\nKIND OF SCARY\n\nPublishing the blog post\nSending the piece of email marketing\nSpeaking to someone on a video call\n\nINTIMIDATING\n\nParticipating in a podcast interview\nSpeaking as a member of a panel\nPresenting a live webinar\n\nTERROR LEVEL 100\n\nDelivering the keynote speech at a conference\nHosting a live video on a social media platform\nPublishing and promoting a book\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nI didn’t go from the Non-scary stuff to the Terror Level 100 list.\n\nInstead, I moved from the Non-scary to the Kind of Scary stuff. I mastered the Kind of Scary list and moved on to the Intimidating list. I got comfortable with the Intimidating list and found myself ready to tackle the Terror Level 100 list.\n\nAll the while, my visibility increased. My success mindset became more resilient.\n\nAs you push into your next level of discomfort, you’ll find yourself being asked to participate in highly visible online events. People will ask you to write blog posts for them; appear on their podcasts; deliver the keynote addresses at their conferences.\n\nThe good news?\n\nYou’ll have a strong success mindset and you’ll be ready for it all.\n\n3. Get support for the scary stuff to strengthen your success mindset\n\nWe already talked about how introverts can thrive online.\n\nWe sit alone at our screens, crafting information and messages that reach across the world and draw an audience to us … without having to leave the comfort of our homes, if we don’t want to.\n\nBut sitting in comfort stops you from growing into an online leadership role that will benefit you and your business.\n\nWhen it comes to moving yourself along the “visibility spectrum” toward a leadership role, it’s incredibly helpful to have a group of supportive colleagues by your side. People who share your dreams; empathize with your frustrations; and are generous with their support.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve reached out to colleagues and said something along the lines of …\n\n“Argh! I know I need to do this but it’s scary!”\n\nHaving a team of people around you that you can be “real” with is vital if you want to move yourself along that visibility spectrum.\n\nI’m very happy to say that a I’m building that team of people for you right now.\n\nIf you’d like to find out more about the BIG League — my community for online business builders — download the Online Business Success Roadmap. It’s the approach we follow in the program.\n\nHere’s how to switch up your success mindset and become the online leader your business needs\n\nLet’s quickly recap what we covered in this article:\n\nStart small and recognize that no one is watching. The early days are the perfect time to explore things that feel uncomfortable — your audience is small and you won’t feel as intimidated.\nDon’t throw yourself in the deep end on Day 1. Remember, online leadership and authoritative visibility exist on a spectrum. Move along it step-by-step and your confidence will grow naturally.\nGet support for the scary stuff. If you are truly committed to growth, consider joining a group where the other members will have your back and offer support when you’re about to take a big, scary step.\n\n“Become an online leader” sounds like a tall order. But it doesn’t have to be! Take it step-by-step and get support for the hard parts and you’ll get there before you know it.\n\nShare this information, please?\n\nA favor: would you take a moment to share this information?\n\nAs I said earlier, I don’t see anyone else talking about how building up to an online leadership role will grow your business — and how to do it with less stress.\n\nI’d really love to get this information out to more people, so if you can take a moment to share, I’d appreciate it.\n\nComing next: how to make Plan & Grow BIG work for your business\n\nIn the final article in this series, we’re going to dig deep into how the Plan & Grow BIG approach to building an online business really works — and how to put it to use in your business.\n\nIt’s all about finding your starting point and focusing on the milestones that are just ahead.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, I’ll show you the path to take to get your online business off to a great start.\nIf you’ve already built your online business but it hasn’t reached its full potential, you’ll discover some new ideas for skyrocketing your growth.\n\nGo forth and lead\n\nNow you know a natural progression you can use to step into an online leadership role that will grow your reach and your revenues.",

        "articleBody": "Pittsburgh\n\nBrock Nelson's second goal of the game 2:55 into overtime capped a frantic comeback to lift the New York Islanders over the Pittsburgh Penguins 5-4 Tuesday night to extend their unbeaten streak to 15 games.\n\nThe Islanders trailed by two late in the third period before goals by Josh Bailey and Ryan Pulock in the final 4:29 of regulation forced overtime. Nelson won it when he fired a shot at Matt Murray that trickled to the goaltender's right. Nelson tapped the rebound into the open net for his sixth goal of the season.\n\nAnthony Beauvillier added his seventh for the Islanders, and Semyon Varlamov stopped 27 shots as New York improved to 14-0-1 in its last 15 games.\n\nWild 4, Sabres 1: Zach Parise scored twice, Alex Stalock made 30 saves and Minnesota beat Buffalo. Jason Zucker had a goal and an assist, and Jonas Brodin also scored for the Wild, who improved to 4-2-1 in their last seven. Brandon Montour scored for the Sabres and Linus Ullmark stopped 22 shots. Buffalo is on a 1-6-2 skid and battling injuries at the forward position following 9-2-1 start.\n\nBruins 5, Devils 1: David Pastrnak and Matt Grzelcyk scored two goals apiece, and Brad Marchand added three assists to lead Boston. Tuukka Rask made 25 saves and New Jersey native Connor Clifton added a goal as the Bruins beat the Devils for the eighth time in nine meetings. Blake Coleman scored for New Jersey, which was looking for its first three-game winning streak since December 2018.\n\nPanthers 5, Flyers 2: Aleksander Barkov and Brett Connolly each had a goal and an assist to lift Florida. Jonathan Huberdeau, Colton Sceviour and Mike Hoffman also scored and Evgenii Dadonov had two assists. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 35 shots. The Panthers are 6-2-1 in their past nine games.\n\nBlue Jackets 5, Canadiens 2: Pierre-Luc Dubois had two goals and an assist, rookie Emil Bemstrom added a goal and an assist, and Columbus beat Montreal. Joonas Korpisalo stopped 30 shots for his eighth win as Columbus improved to 8-8-4. Eric Robinson and Boone Jenner also scored for the Blue Jackets. Artturi Lehkonen and Joel Armia had the goals for the Canadiens.\n\nSenators 4, Red Wings 3: Anthony Duclair had two goals and an assist, and Ottawa held on to beat Detroit. John Gabriel Pageau and Brady Tkachuk also scored for Ottawa. Anders Nilsson made 35 saves, including 15 in the third period when the Senators were outshot 16-3. Valtteri Filppula had a goal and an assist, and Robby Fabbri and Anthony Mantha scored for Detroit, which ended a five-game point streak (3-0-2).\n\nJets 2, Predators 1: Patrik Laine and Nikolaj Ehlers scored, Connor Hellebuyck made 38 saves and Winnipeg defeated Nashville. The teams are heading in opposite directions in the tough Central Division. Winnipeg has won three in a row and five of six. The reeling Predators have lost five straight.\n\nBlues 3, Lightning 1: Oskar Sundqvist and David Perron scored to lead St. Louis past Tampa Bay, spoiling Pat Maroon's much-anticipated return after helping his hometown team to a Stanley Cup title last season. Maroon, a St. Louis native, made his first trip back to the city since signing a one-year contract with the Lightning in the offseason.\n\nHurricanes 4, Blackhawks 2: Nino Niederreiter had a goal and an assist, and Carolina beat Chicago for their fourth straight victory.\n\nNote: Garnet Hathaway was ejected for spitting on an opponent and now the Capitals' winger may have to swallow more punishment from the NHL. Hathaway was given a match penalty for spitting on Anaheim defenseman Erik Gudbranson in a brawl during the Capitals' 5-2 victory Monday. That carries with it an automatic suspension pending a review by the NHL, and it is likely the Capitals won't have Hathaway in the lineup Wednesday night in New York against the Rangers.",

        "articleBody": "(CNN) President Donald Trump, according to the White House, made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed hospital on Saturday for a \"quick exam and labs\" as the first stage of his annual physical.\n\nYou shouldn't just believe them.\n\nWhich is not to say that whatever happened on Saturday wasn't minor or maybe even routine. What it is to say is that this is a President and a White House who have set a standard of dishonesty and obfuscation -- up to and including the President's health -- that should force any rational person to question the explanation currently being offered by the White House.\n\nRemember what we already know about this President's health. Trump is 73 years old and is the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. In his most recent physical exam -- conducted in February -- he clocked in at 243 pounds.\n\nIn his previous physical conducted in 2018, Trump had been diagnosed with a common form of heart disease and high cholesterol. (As CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta noted at the time, Trump's heart disease meant that the President had a moderate risk of a heart attack in the following 3-5 years, according to guidance from the Mayo Clinic.)\n\nAt the time of his 2018 physical, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who was then serving as the President's physician, suggested that the President change his diet and get on a regular exercise regimen. Aside from regular rounds of golf, there is very little public evidence that Trump has taken that advice to heart. Sources told CNN that a year later, Trump had made only minor changes to his food intake and exercise habits.\n\n\"The President received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,\" said Hogan Gidley, the principal deputy White House press secretary.\n\nNow consider what we know about Trump's visit to Walter Reed on Saturday. It was unscheduled. Unlike his past physicals, it was not on his public schedule and was not announced to reporters. The medical staff did not get a heads up that a \"VIP\" guest was coming, as they typically would. While White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the trip was simply Trump getting a jump on his annual physical, he did not have that physical done in phases or over multiple days in the past two years.\n\nSo, there's reason -- lots of it! -- to wonder. Especially when you consider that Trump has shown little hesitation to doctor, um, doctor's reports in the past.\n\nIn December 2015, shortly before voting began in the Republican presidential primary, Trump released a letter from his longtime physician Dr. Harold Bornstein.\n\n\"His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,\" Bornstein wrote of Trump. \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\n\nIf it seemed like Trump had written the letter himself, it's because he had! Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump \"dictated that whole letter. I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along.\"\n\nSo, the paper-thin medical \"record\" that Trump provided to quiet questions about whether he was physically and mentally up to the job of being president was made up. It wasn't based on Bornstein's medical judgment. It was Trump doing what he always does -- making up a story to tell himself and the public.\n\n(Trump, it's also worth noting, repeatedly sought to make Hillary Clinton's health an issue in the 2016 campaign -- particularly after she was seen feeling faint at a September 11 commemoration.)\n\nGiven that history -- and the fact that Trump has made more than 13,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker -- there is every reason to suspect the original story the White House is telling doesn't paint the full picture.\n\n\"We're not going to get into security and movement protocols when it comes to the President, but as my statements said he's in good health and it was a routine checkup as part of his annual physical,\" Grisham told CNN. \"I've given plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate -- actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop.\"\n\nWhich is exactly the problem. Grisham, by her own accounting, has given \"plenty of on-the-record statements that were truthful and accurate.\" Which, of course, means she has given some that, well aren't.\n\nThis -- right here -- is why a White House that lies as easily as it tells the truth creates major problems for the media and the country. How can we take the White House's word for it when that word has, on so many occasions, been false. The answer is that we can't take their word for it. And neither should you.",

        "articleBody": "Time is not on Adam Schiff’s side.\n\nAdam Schiff’s impeachment inquiry is incoherent. Given the impossibility of a senatorial conviction, the only strategy is to taint the president with the brand of impeachment and weaken him in the 2020 election.\n\nYet Schiff seems to have no sense that the worm has already turned. Far from tormenting Trump and the Republicans by a long-drawn-out Schiff extravaganza, Trump’s supporters are beginning to feel that the longer the farce, the better the optics. Polls show that Trump is almost back to where he was in popularity when Schiff unleashed his late-September Ukrainian caper. And the point, after all, was again to drive down Trump’s popularity and render him politically inert.\n\nFrom the day Schiff reemerged after his licking his wounds in hibernation, following the Mueller implosion, his efforts have insidiously gone downhill. Once Trump released the transcript of his July 25th call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, the nation learned that the Schiff’s gold-standard whistleblower was no such thing. Instead, he seems a rank partisan and sloppy leaker whose machinations and background are already boomeranging back on those who put him up to this present circus.\n\nSchiff never expected that Trump would release a classified transcript of his own presidential call — Democrats expected secrecy and coverup, much as the deep-state intelligence-agency miscreants acted unethically and illegally on the presumption that Hillary Clinton would be easily elected and their dishonest efforts would be rewarded and kept quiet.\n\nOne of the strangest developments of the opening inquiry was Schiff’s own doubling-down admission that he didn’t know the name of the whistleblower. After previously lying that neither he nor his staff had contact with the whistleblower (“We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower”) — he now ups the ante, apparently assuming that neither his staff nor the whistleblower will testify under oath.\n\nSchiff’s astounding assertion that he doesn’t know the whistleblower’s name is as hard to believe as Robert Mueller’s own congressional testimony that he was not familiar with Fusion GPS — the font of the entire Steele dossier that itself fueled the collusion fantasy that led to Mueller’s own appointment.\n\nUnlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings, Schiff has no special prosecutor’s finding of felonious presidential behavior. Instead, he has a veritable exoneration from the failure of the ill-starred special counsel to find either collusion or actionable obstruction of such a non-crime.\n\nMueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and related matters in the 2016 election. Twenty-two months, over 20 lawyers and investigators and $35 million later, Mueller folded his tent without criminal referrals or findings of presidential crimes, and then he more or less embarrassed the entire investigation in an enfeebled, deer-in-the-headlights congressional testimony.\n\nAt this point, the country would not put up with yet another special prosecutor entrusted to investigate “Ukrainian collusion.” They would know the post-Mueller drill in advance: A Washington “wise man” icon would follow the Mueller script of finding no such crime, while ignoring quite considerable crimes, with the Bidens now playing the role of Hillary Clinton’s bought-and-paid-for Christopher Steele.\n\nMost of Schiff’s witnesses in this inquiry were incoherent in the same critical sense: They never cite knowledge of presidential crimes but feel that Trump is dangerous, given their own disagreements with his supposedly reckless policy. And their chagrin in the end boils down to their empty charges that Trump is appeasing Russia at the expense of the Kurds and Ukraine. Apparently their supposedly superior ancestries, pedigrees, and education should supersede the foreign-policy prerogatives of the president of the United States.\n\nYet our shocked State Department experts somehow cannot explain why they were abjectly silent during the Obama administration when the “reset” proved to be virtual appeasement of Vladimir Putin; when Obama on a hot mic both offered the Russians a disturbing quid pro quo and then followed through on it; when Obama declined to send arms to Ukraine; and when Vice President Joe Biden took over as point man for Ukrainian policy only to leverage U.S. aid in exchange for Ukraine’s ceasing investigations of corruption that eventually would have targeted his own morally compromised son.\n\nAnd why would these career experts be outraged by the Trump administration that at last fulfilled their wildest agendas: ending the reset, upping sanctions against Russians, killing hired Russian thugs in Syria, pulling out of the warped missile agreement with Russia, increasing American and NATO defense expenditures, pumping more oil to lower world prices to the detriment of Russia, and arming Ukraine?\n\nWhat would have been the reaction in 2012 had an anonymous Bush holdover at the Obama National Security Council gone to the IG — but only after first consulting secretly with the staff of Devin Nunes — to claim third-hand knowledge of a confidential Obama phone call to Russia’s President Medvedev? The Bush-era whistleblower, a protégé of John Bolton and Dick Cheney, would then have claimed that he was told by an anonymous NSC leaker that Obama in the call had confirmed his prior hot-mic, quid pro quo promise to drop missile defense in Eastern Europe if Putin would in return give “space” to Obama before the 2012 election — with “space” perhaps defined as the Russians keeping quiet and making Obama’s foreign policy seem successful in the run-up to Election Day. Would there have been impeachment proceedings against Obama? Would Adam Schiff have pleaded to keep the “whistleblower’s” identity secret?\n\nMost significantly, Schiff is now working against the clock.\n\nEach day closer to the November 2020 election is one day nearer to allowing the American people to vote on their first-team president. There is no Nixonian or Clintonian argument that without impeachment, a second-term president could not be brought to heel. Schiff has essentially decided to abort the early 2020 campaign and substitute in its place his star-chamber impeachment.\n\nDay-by-day Schiff’s ginned-up media hysteria has created a virtual news blackout of the Democratic presidential front-runners. We are well into the 2020 campaign and the public knows almost nothing about these would-be presidents other than that in toto they are a strange bunch. The media-starved peripheral candidates such as Kamala Harris and Cory Booker will go the way of the suffocated Beto O’Rourke until someone or something yanks Schiff offstage.\n\nEach day that is wasted is another day that the new House majority did not, as it promised, address substantive issues. Since January 2018, it has not talked of infrastructure, recalibrated trade deals, budgetary compromises, drug prescription pricing, or anything else other than one iteration after another of attacking Trump. Certainly, if they really believed that Trump was an incompetent buffoon, the better strategy would have been to step aside, let him ruin the economy, and then run in 2020 against his incompetence.\n\nIronically, the longer Trump survives, the more likely he’ll grow stronger and dominate the news at the expense of the progressive front-runners. To get attention back from Schiff, the front-runners must become even shriller and crazier — from Bernie Sanders’s declaring an end to all deportations to Elizabeth Warren’s dreaming up an unhinged multi-trillion-dollar wealth tax to pay for “Medicare for all.” What will happen when these barnstorming senators are trapped in an impeachment farce in the Senate?\n\nSchiff also knows that voters have an upcoming rendezvous with the reports of Michael Horowitz and John Durham. If sane, Schiff should hurry up; otherwise James Comey or Andrew McCabe might be indicted and smother his narrative. Horowitz is likely to have more criminal referrals, and Durham might well proceed with indictments — at precisely the time that Schiff is lecturing the nation that its president is a criminal who mysteriously was exonerated by a special counsel.\n\nSchiff is also risking Trump exhaustion — the magical point at which the public tires of the serial psychodramas of the voting-machine ruse, the Electoral College–subversion gambit, removal of Trump by the 25th Amendment, the Logan Act, the emoluments clause, Mueller, Stormy, Cohen, the tax returns, recession, and now Ukraine — seasoned with 90 percent negative media coverage and celebrity outbursts about blowing up, decapitating, or incinerating Trump. In other words, the more Schiff pushes these serial whines, the closer he gets to Election Day, and the more the people shrug and think, “Enough already, just vote.”\n\nVoters are also human. Schiff believes that the more chaos he creates, the more the collective public will fall into a fetal position, cover its ears, and scream, “Make Trump just go away.” But the opposite is more likely: At some point people sympathize not with the stoners of the declared public enemy, but with the stoned target who is ripped and bloodied by the mob. In the final scene from Braveheart, the once-hated Scottish hero William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is stretched, drawn and quartered, and variously tortured before an English crowd\n\nthat’s hissing and calling for more blood — up until a point.\n\nOnce the kings’ torturers exhaust their repertoire of savagery, even the anti-Scottish crowd gets repelled and begins yelling “Mercy!”\n\nSo too, with Trump. After the Dems decided to wage a three-year-long presidential abortion, and attacked Trump’s wife, children, family, businesses, and associates, 24/7, the public has begun finally to wonder at what point enough is enough. People will begin to think the target of unhinged vituperation must be doing something right to warrant such unattractive enemies, and that he is therefore worthy of empathy.\n\nIt is perhaps cruel but nonetheless accurate to note that the more Adam Schiff, who has replaced AOC as the new face of the Democratic party, goes before the cameras, the more the transitory attention goes to his head, the more he lies, habitually proves unethical, and becomes morally compromised. And the more the public becomes repulsed by him.\n\nIn just this latest impeachment iteration, Schiff has already lied about his staff’s prior contacts with the “whistleblower,” read into the record a complete rewriting of the presidential call transcript, and leaked supposedly secret statements from his partisan witnesses. In other words, the more one sees and hears Adam Schiff, the more one is likely to dislike him — including his own party’s presidential candidates.\n\nNancy Pelosi wants to wrap up impeachment as soon as possible before the debates resume in earnest and the primaries start, before the Horowitz and Durham reports, before the bored public wonders where exactly is the smoking gun, and before Trump’s polls get into the high forties. But mostly she just wants to get the off-putting Schiff off the national stage and to end his career as the icon of current progressivism.\n\nWhen Democratic inquisitors are reduced to lecturing the nation that “ hearsay can be much better evidence than direct ” testimony, and when Adam Schiff looks into the cameras and swears he has no idea who the whistleblower is, then it’s time to pack up the circus and leave town.",

In general, here are the steps you can take:\n\nHow to retire early\n\n1. Define early retirement\n\nRetiring early doesn't have to mean never earning a paycheck again — unless you want it to. Many early retirees define it as not having to work to live — i.e. financial independence — but maybe you want to leave your corporate job for something more creative where you can make your own hours. Or perhaps you'd like to focus only on non-income producing hobbies, or work in spurts and travel in between.\n\nThe first step on the path to early retirement is figuring out exactly what that phrase means to you. Establishing your ideal day-to-day will make it easier to plan for — but just so you know, it will probably evolve over time.\n\n2. Take inventory\n\nLeif Dahleen, the blogger behind the Physician on FIRE, retired from anesthesiology at age 43. He says the first step for any aspiring early retiree is to take inventory of their finances.\n\n\"There are two things you need to know in order to make a plan for the future,\" he told Business Insider. \"First, you should calculate your net worth. This can be done in a matter of hours.\"\n\n\"The second thing you need to calculate is your annual spending. You may be able to guesstimate this based on credit-card statements and your checking account habits,\" Dahleen says. \"It's a good idea to set up semi-automated tracking with an app to verify how much money actually goes out the door every year.\"\n\n3. Establish your target number\n\nAfter outlining your version of early retirement, it's time to establish how much money you need to make it a reality.\n\nEarly retiree and self-made millionaire Grant Sabatier suggests having between 25 and 30 times your expected annual expenses saved or invested, plus a year's worth of expenses in cash. In his book \" Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need,\" Sabatier shares the formula he used to calculate his \"target number,\" which he then broke down into monthly, weekly, and even daily savings goals.\n\nThis part may be difficult to calculate on your own, especially when there are multiple scenarios to consider, like how a possible recession would affect your investments. A good financial planner (SmartAsset's free tool can help find one) can help you crunch the numbers and send you home with an actionable plan to achieve your goal — and even hold you accountable, if you want.\n\n4. Live below your means\n\nIt's very difficult to build substantial, long-term wealth if you spend more than you earn. When you're working toward early retirement, it's imperative to live below your means as it's the only way to save and invest aggressively.\n\nFocusing on reducing your biggest expenses, which are probably housing, transportation, and food, can go a long way in the effort to increase your savings rate.\n\nDepending on how much you spend, you'll generally aim for one of three categories of early retirement: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a \"lean\" budget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person.\n\nRegular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year.\n\n5. Leverage your income\n\nIt's crucial to keep your spending in check, but you can only cut costs to a certain degree, says certified financial planner Eric Roberge. You can make an even bigger difference by increasing your income, he and his wife Kali explained on an episode of their podcast \"Beyond Finances.\" Cutting your expenses and daily spending takes continued effort — it's a short-term solution — whereas increasing your positive cash flow is a long-term solution, they said.\n\nSabatier encourages taking up a side hustle to diversify your income streams. The most lucrative side hustles are those that generate passive income, such as real estate, he wrote in his book. Building a passive income business that generates a minimum amount of money to cover your monthly expenses \"gives you more flexibility and potentially the opportunity to reach financial independence very quickly,\" he wrote.\n\n6. Max out your retirement accounts\n\nThere's at least one common strategy present in nearly every story about financial independence and early retirement: early and frequent savings. Oftentimes the best way optimize your savings is through retirement accounts.\n\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs provide unparalleled tax advantages and investment growth. In 2019, you can contribute up to $19,000 pretax to a 401(k) and $6,000 to a traditional IRA for which you can get a tax deduction on your current year's tax return.\n\nThe only caveat to stuffing your retirement accounts to the brim when you're planning to retire early is the restrictions on withdrawals. You won't be able to take any money from your 401(k) without penalty until you've reached age 59 and a half. You can, however, dip into your Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money, and withdraw your contributions — not including any earnings — tax-free, at any time.\n\n7. Invest the money that's left over\n\nIf you're maxing out your retirement accounts, move on to a brokerage account. This is money you can invest directly in the stock market and cash out when you need it.\n\nMany early retirees and self-made millionaires stick to billionaire Warren Buffett's favorite investment: low-cost index funds. Index funds are all-in-one investments that track a specific financial market and are designed to diversify your money and minimize risk.\n\nNeed help crunching the numbers?

If you have a mortgage, consider paying it off\n\nIn preparing for early retirement, eliminating consumer debt with high interest rates is a no-brainer, but paying off a mortgage early with good terms isn't so cut-and-dry. For some, the peace of mind of being liability-free is worth it, while others may argue that the money saved in interest payments would pale in comparison to potential investment returns.\n\nTommy — who only goes by his first name online — retired nearly 10 years ago at age 51, after a more than three-decade career in telecom. He never earned a six-figure salary, but focused on saving consistently since his 20s and living frugally with his wife and three kids, he wrote in a blog post. One of his biggest regrets? Not paying off his mortgage before retiring.\n\n\"So much of our having a great retirement is mental. Being mortgage free certainly adds another level of mental freedom,\" he wrote.\n\n9. Research your options for health insurance\n\nLeaving a full-time employer also means bidding farewell to your employer's health insurance. If you're waiting for Medicare to kick in at 65, usually the most cost-effective option for health insurance — if available to you — is joining a working spouse's employer-sponsored plan.\n\nOtherwise, you may consider continuing coverage through a former employer under COBRA; browsing coverage options and potential subsidies through the Affordable Care Act marketplace; researching health-sharing plans; or getting a part-time job.\n\n10. Make a backup plan\n\nNo matter how foolproof your plan may seem, consider what could go wrong. You may find you hate the unstructured days of early retirement — would you go back to work? Or the economy could tank, taking your net worth with it — would you have room to cut expenses? Running through potential worst-case scenarios is essential when your livelihood is on the line.\n\n11. Put Plan A into action — but enjoy the present, too\n\nTime and discipline are all you need to execute your plan from here on out. Keep saving and investing, but don't forget to live in the present while you can.\n\nAs early retiree Steve Adcock wrote on his blog Think, Save, Retire, \"Sacrifice is necessary to retire early, but it's not all we do, either. It is important to treat and reward ourselves along the way by celebrating those smaller achievements.\"",

        "articleBody": "Shares of construction goods giant Home Depot are dropping in premarket trading after the company cut full-year sales growth guidance. But its lowered forecast isn’t a problem for the overall market, according to Wall Street. That’s good news for investors.\n\nHome Depot (ticker: HD) reported $2.53 in per-share earnings for the third quarter. Wall Street predicted $2.52 a share. The results look OK, but the stock was down 5% in recent trading. Company management said comparable-store sales growth in 2019 will be 3.5%, compared with prior guidance of 4.0%.\n\n“Our third-quarter results reflected broad-based growth across our business, yet sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits associated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,” said CEO Craig Menear in the company’s news release. “We are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions.”\n\nOne Home Depot refers to investments intended to create a “seamless, interconnected shopping experience” for customers.\n\nIn a research report early Tuesday, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski said the market is misinterpreting the results. That creates a buying opportunity, according to the analyst. “Comp sales were light, though operating margins in-line with expectations,” wrote Matuszewski. “We interpret lighter [second-half] results to be more tied to timing of returns on strategic investments versus a softer macro picture.”\n\nHe’s not the only one who isn’t all that worried. Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem points out a couple of additional reasons investors shouldn’t fret. “While certainly a disappointing result, we note that [the company] faced a [0.6% to 0.7%] hurricane headwind in Q3, lumber remains deeply deflationary and Canada a net headwind,” wrote Fadem in a Tuesday research report. “Excluding these items, we believe Q3 comps would have been closer to 5%.”\n\nStill, the stock has slid, and peer Lowe’s (LOW) stock is off too, down 1.8%. Lowe’s reports earnings Wednesday.\n\nHome Depot management hosts a conference call at 9 a.m. ET to discuss results with analysts and investors.\n\nHome Depot shares are up about 40% year to date, easily outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 over the same span.",

        "articleBody": "Средняя суточная калорийность 1694 Ккал.\n\nЭта диета пришла к нам с запада и в своей основе содержит ограничение на количество углеводов. В отличие от всех без исключения остальных диет, диета Аткинса учитывает индивидуальные особенности именно вашего организма. По сути, диета Аткинса представляет из себя комплекс из собственно диеты и системы питания, (сама диета проводится один раз, а система питания удерживает ваш вес в рамках дозволенного).\n\nЭтой диете с успехом следую зарубежные и отечественные знаменитости и видные политические деятели. Тот же принцип использует и знаменитая кремлевская диета. Идеолог диеты, доктор Аткинс, в обязательном порядке требует полное воздержание от каких либо лекарств в период первых двух недель диеты - что, скорее всего, потребует консультации с врачом. Ограничение углеводов в диете будет подразумевать снижение сахара в крови - что так же требует консультации у врача.\n\nДиета противопоказана: при беременности - может неблагоприятно сказаться на ребенке, при кормлении грудью - та же причина, имеются почечная недостаточность - колебания уровня сахара и ряд других.\n\nДиета Аткинса является двухфазной - в первую фазу, продолжительность которой 14 дней, ваш организм будет получать минимально необходимое количество углеводов - что позволит выравнивать баланс калорий за счет расходования внутренних ресурсов из жировых отложений - максимальное снижение веса. По истечении 14 дней ограничение на калорийность продуктов снимается, но остается ограничение на количество углеводов - в этом сложность диеты - максимальное значение определяется индивидуально исходя из особенностей вашего организма - постоянный контроль веса и коррекция баланса углеводов практически на протяжении всей жизни.\n\nНа протяжении двух первых недель количество углеводов не должно превышать 20 грамм в сутки. Среднее значение этого параметра для большинства людей составляет около 40 граммов (превышение приведет к ожирению - что и имеет место быть для большинства людей с избыточным весом - потребляемые одновременно углеводы и жиры не усваиваются одинаково - углеводы как энергетический источник полностью расходуются на поддержание сегодняшних потребностей, а часть жиров запасается - если имел место быть их излишек - наш организм только их и способен запасать - такова наша физиология).\n\nЦифра в 20 грамм легко достижима - это всего-навсего 3 чайных ложки сахарного песка в чай или сдобная булочка - поэтому никакого быстрого питания и перекусов. Для предотвращения таких ситуаций составлен список разрешенных всегда и в любом количестве (условно) продуктов - понятно, что подразумевается ваша инициативность - никаких излишеств - кушаем только тогда, когда появилось устойчивое чувство голода - никаких чипсов за сериалами.\n\nСписок разрешенных продуктов в меню диеты Аткинса:\n\nлюбая рыба (и морская и речная)\nлюбая птица (включая дичь)\nлюбые морепродукты (ограничение по количеству на устрицы - но лучше заранее рассчитать рецепт)\nв любом виде яйца (можно и куриные и перепелиные)\nлюбой твердый сыр (на некоторые сорта ограничение по количеству - заранее рассчитать рецепт)\nвсе типы овощей (употребление которых можно в сыром виде)\nлюбые свежие грибы\n\nДополнительное ограничение - нельзя за один прием пищи употреблять дневную норму углеводов в сочетании и с белками (птица, мясо) и с жирами. Необходимо выдержать интервал в 2 часа. На сочетание белки и жиры этого ограничения нет.\n\nСписок запрещенных продуктов:\n\nалкоголь в любом виде\nжиры искусственного происхождения\nсахар в любом виде (иначе выйдите за пределы дневной нормы по другим продуктам)\nфрукты (во всех большое содержание углеводов - даже в среднем лимоне их почти 5 грамм)\nовощи с большим содержанием крахмала (картофель, кукуруза - рассчитать рецепт)\nкондитерские изделия (все содержат сахар)\nхлебобулочные изделия (большое содержание крахмала)\n\nСписок продуктов с ограничением по количеству\n\nкапуста\nкабачок\nгорох\nпомидоры\nлук\nсметана (низкокалорийный аналог сметаны) и ряд других продуктов.\n\nПить можно и обычную, и минеральную воду, и чай, и кофе, и Coca-Cola Light - любой напиток без углеводов (например, стакан виноградного сока содержит почти 30 грамм углеводов - а это явный перебор суточной нормы).\n\nВторая фаза диеты Аткинса\n\nВторая фаза диеты еще более простая - организм уже привыкает к ряду ограничений, и обмен веществ переориентирован на расходование внутренних жировых резервов.\n\nДопустимая суточная норма углеводов приближается примерно к 40 граммам (для каждого человека индивидуально). Но теперь требуется постоянный контроль веса - снижение жировых отложений будет продолжаться (но несколько медленнее). Как только достигните оптимального для вас веса можно понемногу добавлять в меню углеводные продукты - пока вес не начнет увеличиваться - это и будет ваш индивидуальный уровень углеводов (максимальный именно для вас). В дальнейшем перейдете этот уровень - начнете набирать вес - и наоборот.\n\nКонечно, в дальнейшем, скорее всего вы допустите некоторые излишества по объективным причинам - например, поездка на отдых, сопровождаемая алкоголем - понятно, что наберете небольшой излишний вес - уменьшите потребление углеводов до 20 грамм в сутки - как в первой фазе - пока не приведете свой вес к норме.\n\nДостоинства диеты Аткинса\n\nС одной стороны диета крайне простая и легко выполнимая - ограничения несущественны и легко выполнимы. Разрешенные диетой продукты включают продукты, полностью запрещенные в других диетах (сметана, яйца, сыр, мясо и мясные изделия). Диета Аткинса высокоэффективная - следуя ее рекомендациям, вы медленно, но верно будете сбрасывать вес до нормы. Несомненным плюсом диеты Аткинса является нормализация режима питания и обмена веществ. Сюда же нужно отнести и отсутствие ограничений на число и время приемов пищи.\n\nНедостатки диеты Аткинса\n\nДиета Аткинса не является полностью сбалансированной (но в этом плане она в разы превосходит другие диеты) - возможно, может потребоваться дополнительный прием витамино-минеральных комплексов. Минусом диеты Аткинса является ее продолжительность - всю жизнь контролировать баланс углеводов. Конечно, отрицательно для этой диеты сказывается и необходимость предварительного расчета рецептов по таблицам.",

        "articleBody": "Beauty company Coty is breaking out — in a good way.\n\nThe stock added more than 2% to begin the week after the beauty brand took a majority stake in Kylie Jenner's cosmetics company in a deal worth $600 million. Those gains add to a major gain for shares, climbing more than 80% so far this year.\n\nMatt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, says the stock could be a risky bet with a worthy reward.\n\n\"This is a stock that until this year had been getting clobbered,\" Maley said on CNBC's \" Trading Nation\" on Monday. \"It was down for four straight years, down well over 60%, and the rally has only just recently broken above that multiyear trend line. If it can take it a little bit further and break above $13.60, that will follow that upward break of the trend line with a very nice higher high and will confirm that its long-term trend has broken to the upside.\"\n\n\"A little bit more risk but more reward because whenever you buy any stock in the early stages of a change in trend, it always gives you a little more upside potential,\" Maley said.\n\nThe Coty-Kylie Jenner deal could be the beginning of a new trend for consumer-facing stocks, says John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.\n\n\"Here's a company that's willing to pay for the eyeballs and the followers that Kylie Jenner has more so than anything else. So, this could be a new paradigm for the consumer staples, packaged goods industry which, you know, has been suffering because of weak mall traffic and the rise of e-commerce because shelf space has basically become infinite,\" Petrides said during the same segment.\n\nCoty acquired a 51% ownership position in Jenner's beauty and cosmetics portfolio, a deal announced at the beginning of the week. Jenner still has a partnership with Ulta Beauty to sell her products in its stores. That relationship began last November and led to several quarters of revenue growth for Ulta.\n\n\"I would expect more acquisitions like this going forward because it could be the new model for companies to acquire top-line growth by partnering up with key influencers,\" Petrides said.\n\nDisclaimer",
